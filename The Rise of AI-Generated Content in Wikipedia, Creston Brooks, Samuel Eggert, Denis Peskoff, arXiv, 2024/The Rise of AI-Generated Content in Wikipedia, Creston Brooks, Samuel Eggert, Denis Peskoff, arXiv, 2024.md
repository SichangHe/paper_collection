## Abstract

![0_Image_0.Png](0_Image_0.Png)

The rise of AI-generated content in popular information sources raises significant concerns about accountability, accuracy, and bias amplification. Beyond directly impacting consumers, the widespread presence of this content poses questions for the long-term viability of training language models on vast internet sweeps.

We use GPTZero, a proprietary AI detector, and Binoculars, an open-source alternative, to establish lower bounds on the presence of AIgenerated content in recently created Wikipedia pages. Both detectors reveal a marked increase in AI-generated content in recent pages compared to those from before the release of GPT3.5. With thresholds calibrated to achieve a 1%
false positive rate on pre-GPT-3.5 articles, detectors flag over 5% of newly created English Wikipedia articles as AI-generated, with lower percentages for German, French, and Italian articles. Flagged Wikipedia articles are typically of lower quality and are often self-promotional or partial towards a specific viewpoint on controversial topics.

## 1 Ai-Generated Content

As Large Language Models (LLMs) have become increasingly advanced and more accessible, the risks of convincingly generated text grow in tandem with the benefits. While benefits include easier communication through machine translation, increased productivity, and new pedagogical opportunities, risks include the increased scale of disinformation and misinformation (Goldstein et al., 2023).

Unchecked resampling of AI-generated data for training can even, in extreme cases, cripple model performance (Shumailov et al., 2024). Risks can be mitigated, however, to the extent that AI-generated data can be detected reliably at scale.

With the rapid release of generative LLMs, AI
detection has been developing in parallel (Tang et al., 2024). Individuals (Ferrara, 2024), educators (Baidoo-Anu and Ansah, 2023; Khalil and

Figure 1: Using two tools, GPTZero and Binoculars, we detect that as many as 5% of 2,909 English Wikipedia articles created in August 2024 contain significant AI-generated content. The classification thresholds of both tools were calibrated to maintain a FPR of no more than 1% on a pre-GPT-3.5 Wikipedia baseline, as indicated by the red line.
Er, 2023), companies (Jabeur et al., 2023; Adelani et al., 2020), and governments (Androutsopoulou et al., 2019) seek reliable ways of validating that content has been generated by human authors rather than machines. Nonetheless, evaluating AI detectors across diverse contexts (e.g., length, domain, and level of integration with human writing) remains challenging (Bao et al., 2023; Sadasivan et al., 2023; Liang et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2024).

Wikipedia is a longstanding, publicly-curated reference source for an expansive and ever-growing set of topics. In the era of LLMs, it has become a standard source of training data due to its breadth of information, standards of curation, and flexible licensing. Therefore, it is an important testing ground for the proliferation of AI-generated content. We collect Wikipedia pages created in August 2024 and use a previously curated dataset of pages created prior to March 2022 as a pre-GPT-3.5 base1 line for our experiments (Section 3).1 We detect a noticeable increase in AI-generated content in the 2024 data and qualitatively assess flagged articles (Section 5). We compare these findings with preliminary experiments conducted on other contemporary sources (Section 6) and comment on the implications of AI-generated content (Section 7).

## 2 Detection Tools

We use two prominent detection tools which were suitably scalable for our study. GPTZero (Tian and Cui, 2023) is a commercial AI detector that reports the probabilities that an input text is entirely written by AI, entirely written by humans, or written by a combination of AI and humans. In our experiments we use the probability that an input text is entirely written by AI. The black-box nature of the tool limits any insight into its methodology.

An open-source method, Binoculars (Hans et al., 2024) uses two separate LLMs M1 M2 to score a text s for AI-likelihood by normalizing perplexity by a quantity termed cross-perplexity, which computes the average cross-entropy between the outputs of two models over a span of tokens:

$$B_{{\mathcal M}_{1},{\mathcal M}_{2}}(s)=\frac{\log{\mathrm{PPL}}_{{\mathcal M}_{1}}(s)}{\log{\mathrm{X}}{\mathrm{-PPL}}_{{\mathcal M}_{1},{\mathcal M}_{2}}(s)}$$

The input text is classified as AI-generated if the score is lower than a determined threshold, calibrated according to a desired false positive rate
(FPR). For our experiments, we use Falcon-7b and Falcon-7b-instruct (Almazrouei et al., 2023)
to calculate cross-perplexity, following Hans et al.

(2024) who report it as the best pair of LLMs for detection. Compared to competing open-source detectors, Binoculars reports superior performance across various domains including Wikipedia (Hans et al., 2024).

## 3 Wikipedia Data Sources

Wikipedia provides an accessible list of articles created within the past month for supported languages.

We use the *New Pages* feature to collect articles created in August 2024 in English, French, German, and Italian (Table 2). These languages were also available in a set of Wikipedia pages collected before March 2022.2 1Our data collection and evaluation code is available at github.com/brooksca3/wiki_collection.

2https://huggingface.co/datasets/legacy-datas ets/wikipedia Although GPT-3 was released in June 2020, the significant public uptake in generating text with LLMs occurred in March 2022 with the release of GPT-3.5 and exploded with ChatGPT in November 2022 (Wu et al., 2023). Thus, the dataset of articles created prior to March 2022 allows us to establish a FPR for the tools in detecting AI-generated content post-GPT-3.5.

| Language   | Pre-March 2022   | August 2024   |
|------------|------------------|---------------|
| English    | 2965             | 2909          |
| German     | 4399             | 3907          |
| Italian    | 2306             | 3003          |
| French     | 4351             | 3138          |

Table 1: Number of Wikipedia pages collected for each language before March 2022 and in August 2024 after removing articles containing fewer than 100 words. We take random subsets of our data pools to stay within budget constraints.

## 4 Detection As A Lower Bound

Following Latona et al.'s (2024) approach for measuring AI content in conference reviews, we estimate a lower bound for AI-generated articles by subtracting the percentage of pre-March 2022 articles classified as AI by a given tool from the percentage of August 2024 articles classified as AI.

As we do not have ground-truth examples of AIgenerated articles, we do not attempt to estimate the false negative rate (FNR). Doing so would require creating artificial positive examples by simulating the various ways Wikipedia authors might use LLMs to assist in writingâ€”taking into account different models, prompts, and the extent of human integration, among other factors.

Although we cannot speculate on how GPTZero scores text, Falcon models are trained on Wikipedia data (Almazrouei et al., 2023), and Binoculars is known to assign false positives to text in its models' training data (Hans et al., 2024). Additionally, the tools we use are primarily for detecting AI-generated content in English. While GPTZero supports Spanish and French, it is not designed for other languages (GPTZero, 2024), and using it outof-domain may increase FNRs. For non-English texts, Binoculars reports similar FPRs but higher FNRs (Hans et al., 2024). The higher the FNRs, the more AI-generated articles slip past the detectors.

Therefore, while the numbers we report represent a lower bound, the actual amount of AI-generated content could be substantially higher.

| Language             | Footnotes per Sentence   | Outgoing Links per Word   |                  |       |
|----------------------|--------------------------|---------------------------|------------------|-------|
| AI-Detected Articles | All New Articles         | AI-Detected Articles      | All New Articles |       |
| English              | 0.667                    | 0.972                     | 0.383            | 1.77  |
| French               | 0.370                    | 0.441                     | 0.474            | 1.58  |
| German               | 0.180                    | 0.211                     | 0.382            | 0.754 |
| Italian              | 0.549                    | 0.501                     | 1.16             | 1.64  |

Table 2: Mean values for footnotes per sentence and outgoing links per word in all articles created in August 2024, as well as those detected as AI-generated by either GPTZero or Binoculars, with thresholds set to induce a 1%
FPR for each tool. The number of AI articles are 207, 174, 249, and 206 for English, French, German, and Italian.
Our methodology assumes that the pre-March 2022 and August 2024 data distributions are comparable, with increased AI use being the primary factor affecting detection. One concern is that preMarch 2022 pages may be more polished due to years of editing. However, we observe that a higher number of edits weakly correlates with a higher AI-detection score for pre-March 2022 articles (Appendix D), suggesting that the FPRs for those articles may even be inflated. While the base assumption cannot be watertight, we observe a relatively consistent distribution of page categories between the two data pools, and we rely on the consistency of our chosen tools' reported FPRs.

## 5 Trends In Pages Flagged For Ai

As seen in Figure 1, we estimate that 4.36% of 2,909 English Wikipedia articles created in August 2024 contain significant AI-generated content.3 We set the classification thresholds of both tools to induce a detection rate of no more than 1% on pre-March 2022 articles. With these thresholds, GPTZero classifies 156 English articles as AIgenerated, and Binoculars classifies 96. Among these, there is an overlap of 45 articles classified as AI independently by the two tools. Notably, there is no overlap between the 39 and 31 pre-March 2022 English articles flagged as AI-generated by the tools. Hence, there is a strong shared signal in assumed true positives but tool-specific noise in false positives.

The quality of articles detected as AI-generated is generally lower on at least two axes. Table 2 shows how, compared to all articles created in August 2024, AI-generated ones use fewer references and are less integrated into the Wikipedia nexus.4

35.36% detection rate with 1% FPR. 4We normalize by sentence and word count to remove length as a confounding factor, since longer articles may have more footnotes and links without being higher quality.

## 5.1 Manual Inspection

We inspect each of the 45 English articles flagged as AI-generated by both GPTZero and Binoculars by examining their edit histories and the activity logs of their creators to better understand the motivations for using LLMs to create Wikipedia pages.

We observe that several of the 45 pages are authored by the same individuals, which is unsurprising, as users who use AI in one article are likely to use it in others. Most of the 45 pages are flagged by moderators and bots with some warning, e.g.,
"This article does not cite any sources. Please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources" or even "*This article may incorporate text* from a large language model." We observe distinct trends after inspecting the user and page histories.

## 5.2 Advertisement

One prominent motive is self-promotion. Of the 45 flagged pages, we identify eight that were created to promote organizations such as small businesses, restaurants, or websites. These pages are often the first to be created by their respective users and typically lack any citations beyond links to the entity being promoted. One page links to a personal YouTube video promoting a winery with fewer than 100 views. Another describes an estate in the United Kingdom, claiming it has formerly had notable residents. This is subsequently deleted by a moderator who notes:
"*Reference links are all dead apart from* one for the town council, which makes no mention of the estate. One link is actually labelled 'fictional'... Article reads like an advert for the house, which is coincidentally up for sale at the moment."
Other self-promoting pages are deleted by moderators who remark: "*unambiguous advertising which* only promotes a company, group, product, service, person, or point of view."
Figure 2: The activity of this user, who was flagged for instigating an 'Edit War,' reveals that within a single day,

![3_image_0.png](3_image_0.png)

![3_image_3.png](3_image_3.png)

![3_image_4.png](3_image_4.png)

they created three articles (red border), all identified as AI-generated. Notably, at 13:00 (green border), the user edited the outcome of 'War in Dibra' from 'Mixed Results' to *'Victory'* and removed key text, just an hour before creating a new page titled 'Uprising in Dibra.' That page (see Figure 3) has since been deleted by moderators.

## 5.3 Pages Pushing Polarization

While the immediate beneficiaries of advertisement are obvious, we also identify pages that advocate a particular viewpoint on often polarizing political topics. We identify eight such pages out of the flagged 45. One user created five articles on English Wikipedia, detected by both tools as AIgenerated, on contentious moments in Albanian history. The same user's profile garnered a warning from Wikipedia for engaging in an 'Edit War' with other users (Figure 2). The user changed outcomes of an Albanian conflict from *'Mixed Results'* to
'Victory' and deleted supporting text, before using AI to generate an entirely new page on said conflict. The Wikimedia community has since removed the flagged pages and banned the user in question for sockpuppetry.5In other cases, users created articles ostensibly on one topic, such as types of weapons or political movements, but dedicated the majority of the pages' content to discussing specific political figures. We find two such articles that espouse non-neutral views on JD Vance and Volodymyr Zelensky.

## 5.4 Machine Translation

AI detection tools can flag instances of machine translation. We find three cases where users explicitly documented their work as translations, including pages on Portuguese history and legal cases

in Ghana. Outside of the 45 articles flagged by

![3_image_1.png](3_image_1.png)

![3_image_2.png](3_image_2.png)

both tools, we identify a top contributor of Italian Wikipedia who created 57 articles flagged as AIgenerated by Binoculars, but not by GPTZero.

6 This user notes in their sandbox that they translated these articles from French Wikipedia, a common practice in the Wikimedia editor community (Zhu and Walker, 2024).

Despite producing fluent and accurate translations, state-of-the-art LLMs still introduce observable biases (Hendy et al., 2023). Even beyond these biases, machine translation complicates the process of vetting pages flagged for AI content: an AIgenerated article in one language can be translated and propagated into other languages. For example, Wikipedia communities like Cebuano and Swedish contain millions of pages made through automatic methods (Alshahrani et al., 2023).

## 5.5 Writing Tool

Other pages, which are often well-structured with high-quality citations, seem to have been written by users who are knowledgeable in certain niches and are employing an LLM as a writing tool. Several of the flagged pages are created by users who churn out dozens of articles within specific categories, including snake breeds, types of fungi, Indian cuisine, and American football players. One flagged page points us to a user who seemingly uses AI to cre-

ate chapter-by-chapter books summaries. Another page details an ongoing criminal case in India and is flagged by moderators with a warning reminding editors to treat subjects as innocent until proven guilty.

## 6 Detection Beyond Wikipedia

Wikipedia has a distinct genre and brand of contributor. To contextualize our findings and motivate further research, we conduct a preliminary investigation into two other genresâ€”comment-section debates and press releasesâ€”on platforms where contributors may have different motivations for using generative AI compared to those on Wikipedia.

We hope this encourages closer examination of AIgenerated content across different domains with varying contributor incentives.7

## 6.1 Reddit

Comments on contentious subredditsâ€”IsraelPalestine, public opinion on Democrats, public opinion on Republicansâ€”are updated daily on Kaggle, a popular data science platform. We randomly sample 3,000 user comments from 2024 containing at least 100 words.

Less than 1% of the collected comments receive a GPTZero score above 0.5, which may mean (1)
few are AI-generated, (2) such content is censored or (3) AI presence is difficult for detectors to discern in this domain. Despite being rare, some comments flagged as AI-generated are potentially worrisome: one urges others how to vote in an upcoming election (Appendix B).

## 6.2 Press Releases

The United Nations "remains the one place on Earth where all the world's nations can gather together, discuss common problems, and find shared solutions that benefit all of humanity".8 Country teams of the United Nations provide frequent updates about developments in that country. We collect 8,326 press releases across 60 country teams from the United Nations from 2013 to 2024; country teams have websites in the format of https://{country}.un.org.9

7Full details about the sources we evaluated and instructions for replicating the evaluation are available at our repository: github.com/brooksca3/wiki_collection.

8https://www.un.org/
9Due to licensing uncertainties, we do not release the press releases; however, we release the scripts used to collect them.
As many as 20% of press releases published in 2024 received a GPTZero AI-generation score of at least 0.5, compared to 12.5% in 2023, 1.6% in 2022, and less than 1% in all years prior.10 The marked increase in UN press releases flagged as AI may stem from translations into English, although the individuals named as authors of the articles often hold degrees from institutions in Englishspeaking countries. We include three examples of flagged press releases in Appendix C.

## 7 Implications And Conclusion

Not all AI-generated text is nefarious. If a human authors the primary content and approves an AIgenerated summary or translation, AI may be considered a writing aide. Shao et al. (2024) have even designed a retrieval-based LLM workflow for writing Wikipedia-like articles and gathered perspectives from experienced Wikipedia editors on using itâ€”the editors unanimously agreed that it would be helpful in their pre-writing stage. Moreover, LLMenabled translation can reduce language barriers in domains of information sharing (Katsnelson, 2022; Berdejo-Espinola and Amano, 2023).

However, the increasing ease with which it is possible to generate content at scale to overrepresent a particular perspective has predictable and dangerous consequences. People are more likely to believe statements that are frequently repeated, since familiarity is easily confused with validity
(Hasher et al., 1977; Unkelbach et al., 2019). Consumer confidence is a key determiner of economic strength, and confidence in the economy is based in part on how strong individuals perceive others' confidence to be. To the extent that AI-generated outputs show less variability than human-generated texts, we can expect peaks of polarization to continue to increase (Bail et al., 2018; Heltzel and Laurin, 2020), undermining the useful wisdom of crowds (Surowiecki, 2005; Bender et al., 2021).

Continued work is needed to understand differences in LLMs and human speech and the implications of widespread AI-generated data (Guo et al.,
2023; Sadasivan et al., 2023; Liang et al., 2024).

The motives to discreetly propagate AI-generated text online vary across platforms, and measuring the prevalence of AI-generated content is a necessary step in understanding these motives.

1090/447 press releases from 2024 are flagged, 170/1360 from 2023, and 20/1268 from 2022.

## Limitations

The proprietary nature of GPTZero makes experiments costly to run ($1000 for our study).

Binoculars requires non-trivial RAM and compute to run at scale. These factors bound the scale of the study we are able to conduct and limit our ability to draw generalizable conclusions. We hope that future efforts can replicate this work at a larger scale and across more domains.

Future work should also consider a broader suite of AI detectors. We considered two other opensource AI detection tools but did not use them.

Ghostbuster (Verma et al., 2024) requires training on specific LLM features and Fast-DetectGPT
(Bao et al., 2023) reports lower true positive rates than Binoculars across all domains considered.

Moreover, we focus on English and other high resource languages given their availability in the sources we consider. In the multilingual setting, Liang et al. (2023) detect bias in AI detectors against non-native speakers, Wang et al. (2024)
create a multilingual dataset to study detection, and Ignat et al. (2024) study multilingual detection in the context of hotel reviews.

## Ethical Considerations

Detecting AI may have unexpected negative consequences for people implicated as having generated that text. We have therefore been encouraged to omit any identifying information in the specific pages we discuss; however, we will provide more specific data to researchers upon request provided that it not be disseminated further.

We are relying on public internet content. All sources that we investigate are public-facing in nature. The Wikipedia data we collect is under a Creative Commons CC0 License. The Reddit data is distributed through Kaggle under a Open Data Commons Attribution License (ODC-By) v1.0.

There is no clear license for United Nations country teams. Individual use and download of the data is explicitly permitted by the parent organization.

## B Reddit Post Classified As Ai-Generated

The following comment encouraging Americans to vote for a third-party candidate was flagged as AI.

While the acknowledgment of the symbolic rejection of the two-party system is understood, the contention here lies in the practical consequences of a third-party vote. It's crucial to recognize that the call for voting third party isn't solely symbolic but a strategic push for a more diverse political landscape over time. The argument asserts that voting for anyone other than Biden increases Trump's chance of victory. However, this perspective assumes a binary outcome, overlooking the potential long-term impact of promoting alternative voices. A shift toward a multi-party system is a gradual process, and fostering this change requires voters to make choices aligned with their principles. Moreover, characterizing the choice between a "bland moderate Democrat" and an "extremely corrupt, authoritarian Republican" as high stakes underscores the need for broader political options. Supporting third parties now can pave the way for a more representative democracy in the future, where voters aren't limited to perceived lesser evils. While the current election might seem high-stakes, it's crucial to consider the long-term goal of breaking the duopoly for a healthier democracy. Third-party votes, rather than being mere protests, can be strategic steps toward that transformative change.
