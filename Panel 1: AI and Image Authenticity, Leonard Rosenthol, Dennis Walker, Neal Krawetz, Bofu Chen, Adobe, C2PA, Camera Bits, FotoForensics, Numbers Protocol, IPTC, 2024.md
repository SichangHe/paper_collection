00:01 uh so the first panel session uh is it's
00:05 called Ai and image authenticity and uh
00:09 we have some great people lined up for
00:12 that so Leonard rosenal the um the lead
00:15 author of the cgpa spec and uh also uh
00:20 lead uh of PDF basically in the world uh
00:26 and uh PDF architect for Adobe and uh
00:29 has been working at Adobe for many years
01:32 I actually have a whole bio that I can
01:34 read so joined Adobe for the first time
01:37 in
01:37 1996 and has been involved I believe on
01:41 and off uh since then and uh then we've
01:44 also got Dennis Walker from cits makers
01:47 of photoch mechanic Neil Kravitz I think
01:50 you pronounce it uh of photo forensics
01:53 and bofu Chen of numbers uh protocol so
01:58 I look forward to hearing everyone so
01:01 leonnard would you like to start off I'm
01:03 going to give everyone five minutes to
01:07 speak otherwise we won't have enough
01:08 time
01:09 for uh for questions
01:14 so
01:18 please
01:20 great thank you very much and uh hello
01:23 to everyone from
01:25 Tokyo where more standards are happening
01:27 so I wanted to just take uh those couple
01:30 of minut minutes this morning and
02:32 introduce you to content credentials
02:34 which is the standard produced by the
02:38 Coalition for Content provenance and
02:40 authenticity the ctpa that you've heard
02:43 about already this
02:44 morning I want to start by simp by
02:47 saying as we do within our name it's all
02:50 about provenance so our focus of the
02:54 organization and our belief around what
02:56 is important for content is that is
02:00 important to understand its provenance
02:03 the beginning of its existence its
02:05 origin and its life
02:08 throughout um its existence so we don't
02:12 want to just detect whether or not
02:14 something was generated by AI or not we
02:17 don't want to just detect if potentially
02:19 edits were made we want to document all
02:21 that information because editing
02:23 manipulation are all things that people
02:25 do on a daily basis uh with their
02:28 content and they should be able to
02:29 continue to do that and not have to
03:31 worry that some tool is going to come
03:33 along and maybe think that that was a
03:36 bad thing um so instead we want to
03:38 document the who the what the where the
03:41 when the how and the why of the life of
03:43 a given
03:47 asset and as mentioned this content
03:51 credential standard from the
03:54 ctpa does that and it does that as was
03:57 mentioned before by basically allowing
03:59 you to sign sign an image an audio file
03:03 a video in the same way that you been
03:06 signing PDF files for almost 25 years
03:09 now uh in that you take the information
03:12 about the asset the data it's metadata
03:16 including the IPC data that you've added
03:19 you also can add additional information
03:21 about for example your
03:23 identity uh trusted time and you bundle
03:28 all that together into this thing we
03:29 call a C2 PA manifest or a Content
04:32 credential and it all gets packaged
04:34 together with the asset and Carries
04:36 along with it again just as you've been
04:38 doing with IPC
04:40 metadata you can think of this as a more
04:44 secure tamper evident package of
04:47 metadata
04:49 and that information is not just a
04:52 linear understanding of the metadata of
04:55 the history and provenance of that asset
04:58 but as assets are combined together for
04:01 example you place one photo or a series
04:04 of photos onto a new canvas in Photoshop
04:07 or you use something like a generative
04:09 fill feature to modify your photograph
04:13 to add a little AI fanciness to it then
04:16 your graph it becomes more of a graph
04:18 and a chart because now each one of
04:21 those things represents an ingredient in
04:23 the history and
04:25 provenance so ctpa has been operating
04:28 since 2020 we have many different
05:31 members um almost a hundred at this
05:34 point and you can see various logos of
05:36 folks not only technical companies but
05:39 we also have human rights organizations
05:41 like witness we have Publishers and
05:43 Publishing organizations and we have
05:45 established Leons obviously with the IPC
05:48 but also with uh well-known standard
05:50 organizations such as the iso and uh
05:53 Etsy in the European
05:56 Union as mentioned everything we do and
05:59 T is based on a well understood trust
05:02 model it's the same model of trust that
05:06 has been used as I mentioned with PDF
05:08 for over 25 years and the webs so we are
05:11 all familiar with that little lock icon
05:13 in our browser you can think of this as
05:16 establishing a similar lock icon to your
05:19 assets that you want to be able to see
05:21 some sort of graphical representation
05:24 similar to the Blue Bar in PDF viewers
05:27 or the lock and browsers that let people
06:30 know when they consume your asset hey
06:33 there is provenance here and you can go
06:35 look at it and find out more about this
06:37 asset and that as you heard that
06:40 cryptographic Foundation is not only
06:43 based on those certificates but also on
06:46 those trust lists and so the ctpa has a
06:49 trust list uh we're actually in the
06:51 process of continuing to establish it
06:53 and the rules that we're establishing
06:55 are also going to help guide the IPC and
06:59 its new trust list than those of
06:01 others we also have established rules
06:04 for what's called Hardware attestation
06:06 so this enables Hardware devices such as
06:09 cameras then incorporate ctpa natively
06:13 to also declare that they are doing it
06:15 in a trusted
06:18 environment but as you'll hear a little
06:20 bit uh later and as well known metadata
06:23 can be stripped uh and that includes our
06:25 content credentials uh we don't you know
06:27 we're well aware of that we've known
06:29 that since the beginning beginning of
07:30 the process and so one of the things
07:32 that we are actively working on now is
07:35 taking those content credentials and
07:37 making them more durable so we are
07:40 establishing a series of standards that
07:43 incorporate a three legged approach to a
07:48 stool if you will that enables not only
07:51 the embedding of that provenance but the
07:53 ability to have uh references to that
07:55 provenance from invisible
07:58 watermarks uh and also what are called
07:00 fingerprinting and so the combination of
07:03 these three
07:04 components will enable that content that
07:08 provenance to be located even if it has
07:11 become stripped so you can see for
07:12 example a here is a browser plug-in that
07:17 uh can be used to locate that when it
07:19 has been removed uh there are three such
07:23 browser plugins in existence and more
07:25 importantly we are in conversations with
07:27 the w3c which is the standards body
08:30 responsible for building the open web to
08:33 actually see this type of Technology
08:35 integrated directly into web browsers
08:37 and your web
08:40 platform here we want to talk about
08:42 generative AI That's part of this
08:44 session and so the indication that an
08:46 asset has been produced through
08:48 generative AI using those digital Source
08:50 types that were mentioned earlier is key
08:53 to our um credentials so you can
08:57 identify created by Modified by
08:60 composited with all of those digital
08:01 Source types again expressable in ctpa
08:05 and you can see here on the right the
08:06 example of someone taking a photograph
08:09 of a computer monitor containing an
08:11 image and being able to see that that
08:15 photograph actually traces all the way
08:17 back to the original asset using things
08:20 such as fingerprinting and and
08:21 watermarking part of the durable content
08:24 credentials so this is all part of the
08:26 ecosystem that we are working to
08:28 establish you you also heard about the
09:30 new training and data mining work uh
09:33 that is now part of IPC we've also been
09:36 working on the S same thing and we have
09:39 a similar assertion that's the data
09:41 structure in ctpa for describing
09:43 something with a similar vocabulary we
09:46 were all working together um on defining
09:49 these vocabularies and these
09:51 rules um and they all Trace back to work
09:54 being done by the w3c as well so again a
09:56 lot of alignment here between ctpa and
09:59 IPC in a long history of that and we
09:02 look forward to continued
09:04 work uh I've been talking about this we
09:07 need to wrap it up leard so that's fine
09:10 I'm just wrapping up pretty much last
09:11 slide as I mentioned embeddable in lots
09:14 of formats and also referenceable and
09:16 you'll hear more about that from my
09:17 fellow speakers so thank you all very
09:19 much for your
09:21 time great thank you very much Lenard uh
09:24 so now we move on to the the
09:27 implementers point of view so we get to
09:30 hear Dennis from camber bits photoch
10:32 mechanic on uh what it takes to actually
10:35 make this stuff work in a real image
10:39 editing
10:42 tool great yeah so let me um let me
10:48 uh trying to share just this
10:54 one this one screen here
10:57 okay um so uh yeah so anyway my name is
10:02 Dennis Walker and I'm um a president and
10:05 founder of camera bits since 1996 we
10:09 make a software called photoch mechanic
10:12 and that's used by photo editors uh to
10:14 edit metad data and manage photos so
10:18 today I want to talk about uh recently
10:20 announced technology for preserving uh
10:22 metadata
10:24 Providence um we uh you might see some
10:27 weird words in here about torch and uh
11:30 Flames but that'll could get explained
11:32 here in the next slide so yesterday we
11:35 announced our technology for preserving
11:37 ctpa Province and I uh in the press
11:40 released I use the an analogy of an
11:42 Olympic flame so uh think of a digital
11:46 signature as an Olympic flame and the
11:48 camera ignites the flame and the photo
11:50 is the torch so many times photoch
11:53 mechanic is used uh as the first torch
11:56 Runner um and the torch is passed to
11:58 other Runners using phot mechanic so we
11:01 have a huge responsibility to keep that
11:03 that digital flame
11:05 alive so uh to help uh explain the
11:09 challenge I wanted to kind of go over
11:11 some of the components of what a JPEG
11:13 torch looks like so there's two parts to
11:15 a JPEG there's the metadata and the
11:18 image data so the uh um metadata
11:22 contains editable metadata such as XMP
11:25 XF ICC Etc and the camera uh creates
12:31 the ctpa camera creates a digital
12:34 signature and that's kind of like the
12:36 digital flame and so and the signature
12:40 contains cryptographic hash assertions
12:42 about the contents of the jpeg in order
12:45 to detect uh
12:47 modifications unfortunately photo
12:49 mechanic um is all about making photo uh
12:54 metadata edits so and a lot of them so
12:56 even though we're only modifying the
12:59 metadata the digital signature will
12:01 still become broken because it because
12:03 it only takes a single bit to change the
12:06 cryptographic hash so the challenge is
12:09 how do we allow multiple metadata edits
12:12 without extinguishing the
12:14 flame so our solution to protect the
12:17 digital signature and and the metadata
12:19 Providence is to create a Providence
12:21 Locker this data structure contains all
12:24 the metadata of the original photo U the
12:27 Providence Locker is then inserted back
12:29 into the photo and it replaces the
13:31 digital
13:32 signature this allows photo mechanic or
13:35 other metadata only editors such as exf
13:37 tool to safely edit the metadata because
13:40 the signature is protected and so the
13:43 torch is easily passed on for further
13:45 metadata
13:47 editing once the metadata is finalized
13:50 it's time to pass the torch on to the
13:52 next ctpa application by adding another
13:55 flame so this is where it gets a little
13:57 tricky so those of you who have been
13:60 paid close attention to the Providence
13:02 Locker will recognize that when we
13:04 combine that with the image data we can
13:07 extract or more precisely recreate the
13:09 original signed photo this extracted
13:12 original is then used as a ctpa
13:16 ingredient to carry on the digital
13:18 signature provins also photoch mechanic
13:21 can compare the
13:23 metadata uh between the modified JPEG
13:25 and the original and make ctpa
13:28 assertions that are included in in the
13:29 new ctpa signature that is added to the
14:32 save jpeg so the new jpeg now has two
14:36 flames and the torch can be passed on to
14:38 the next ctpa compliant workflow
14:42 software so in summary uh photo mechanic
14:45 can protect the provence of sign photos
14:47 by using the provence Locker the
14:49 metadata of protected photos can be
14:51 edited repeatedly after the metadata is
14:54 edited photos can be signed and passed
14:56 on to other ctpa compliant software
14:60 and this provides for an efficient and
14:02 authentic metadata editing workflow for
14:04 ctpa photos so therefore we feel there's
14:07 a clear path for news agencies to
14:09 publish authentic photos from capture
14:13 and that concludes my uh presentation
14:15 thank you thank you Dennis that was very
14:22 good sorry thank you very much Dennis
14:25 you managed to come in under your five
14:27 minutes time so it's good we C a little
14:29 bit now so uh next up we have Neil from
15:35 photo
15:36 forensics uh Who and the hacker Factor
15:40 blog so uh I'll just read a little bit
15:43 from the uh bio while Neil shares his
15:46 screen uh Neil is a specialist he
15:49 specializes in unconventional aspects of
15:51 computer forensics he's recognized
15:53 expert in computer security networking
15:55 anti- anonymity Technologies file format
15:57 forensics and media analysis
15:00 so okay you're ready to go so please get
15:03 started can you see my screen pirate we
15:07 can okay uh David Ricks asked me to be
15:10 on this panel and to talk about
15:12 authenticity
15:14 uh there we go uh from the attackers
15:18 perspective a little about me uh I'm
15:20 Neil krowitz my company's hacker factor
15:22 and I develop computer forensic
15:24 software I also run a variety of online
15:27 forensic oriented Services it's from
15:29 these public services that I've gained
16:30 an understanding of how people conduct
16:32 online
16:34 fraud and when I talk about online fraud
16:37 people usually think about news
16:39 outlets and digital alterations or fake
16:41 news but the problem is so much bigger
16:43 than
16:44 that there's insurance fraud banking
16:47 fraud fake injury claims Proof of Life
16:49 Proof of death because you know if
16:51 you're going to pay the hit man you want
16:52 to make sure he actually did the hit uh
16:54 there's propaganda political influence
16:56 media uh medical reports uh sign ific
16:59 research courtroom evidence and much
16:01 more and it's not just the different
16:04 Industries there are also different
16:06 techniques simple fakes Advanced fakes
16:08 deep fakes altered images stage photos
16:10 misrepresented pictures and the list
16:12 goes
16:14 on since we're talking about ctpa I'm
16:17 going to evaluate it using the same
16:18 three-legged approach used by ctpa that
16:20 Leonard just mentioned that's Provence
16:23 watermarking and
16:26 fingerprinting Providence focuses on the
16:28 content of metadata that helps identify
17:30 how file was created and handled all of
17:33 that information is stored in the
17:35 file that means an attacker has direct
17:38 access to the data the attacker can
17:40 easily alter remove replace or re-encode
17:42 the information in order to create a ver
17:45 uh a viable
17:48 forgery MIT technology review described
17:51 this attack method as the shortcomings
17:53 of the ctpa protocol and noted that it
17:56 would not stem the harm of machine
17:57 generated misinformation
17:02 the second leg is watermarking there are
17:04 two different watermarking techniques
17:06 visible and
17:09 invisible invisible requires special
17:11 Technologies to detect and decode The
17:13 Watermark companies like diger
17:15 specialized in invisible watermarks and
17:18 stable diffusion began adding invisible
17:20 watermarks to some of their AI generated
17:24 images visible watermarks are basically
17:26 overlays on the image like the Getty
17:29 images Watermark or the live leak
18:33 logo the catch is it doesn't matter if
18:36 the watermark is visible or
18:38 invisible the watermarking method must
18:41 be disclosed otherwise investigators
18:44 can't see it or validate
18:46 it but if it's disclosed then attackers
18:49 know the method they can easily erase
18:51 the
18:52 watermark or add a fake watermark for
18:57 attribution this is why I Spectrum wrote
18:60 that meta's AI watermarking plan which
18:02 is based on ctpa is flimsy at
18:07 best the third leg is fingerprinting
18:09 that includes visual uh visually similar
18:12 picture search engines as well as the
18:14 mapping of complex file formats and
18:16 Camera artifacts back to the generating
18:18 device or
18:20 application the problem with
18:22 fingerprinting was demonstrated by the
18:24 Russian car company ovas they developed
18:27 a sophisticated forgery method that
18:28 replic Ates fingerprints onto altered
19:31 files resulting in forgeries that look
19:34 original and they have been doing this
19:36 for over a
19:39 decade we've reached the point where
19:41 hackaday post posted an article on
19:43 forging
19:45 fingerprints they called it fooling
19:47 adobe's cryptographically signed
19:48 metadata referring to
19:52 ctpa the root of this problem is trust
19:55 typically we trust the content and the
19:57 metadata
19:59 we use tools excuse me we use tools and
19:03 techniques to help identify alterations
19:06 and validate any assumptions based on
19:09 trust ctpa adds a signature around the
19:13 content and metadata the thing to
19:15 remember is that a strong cryptographic
19:17 signature around untrusted data does not
19:20 make the data more
19:21 trustworthy on top of this ctpa
19:23 introduces more areas of
19:26 trust yeah lots of new things to trust
20:31 everywhere you see the words assume
20:33 trust honesty and not required is a
20:35 vulnerable foothold for anacker to
20:39 exploit to demonstrate how weak this
20:41 model is based on trust I'm going to
20:43 show you one way to create an
20:44 authenticated ctpa forgery in under one
20:46 minute so let me switch
20:49 screens uh this screen
20:53 share
20:55 window uh where did my screen go oh on
20:59 my screen
20:00 vanished uh this one
20:05 share window this
20:09 one so I went to uh Google oh sorry uh
20:13 being image Creator and I had to
20:14 generate an AI uh generated picture this
20:17 morning and so here's the picture I
20:19 chose and I simply saved it as a picture
20:22 called gorilla and if I go to content
20:24 credentials I can load up the gorilla
20:26 picture
20:29 and we can see that it is Data today
21:31 because I made it this morning and it's
21:34 signed by Microsoft and everything's
21:36 legit now I'm going to take my gorilla
21:39 picture I'm going to copy it to gorilla
21:42 edit I'm going to hexedit the gorilla
21:44 edit picture and I'm going to search for
21:47 that date today is
21:49 2024
21:51 0507 there's the Tim stamp and I'm just
21:54 going to backdate it to March
21:56 11th and save that and now I'm going to
21:60 come over here and select my file and
21:02 here's my edited gorilla and we can see
21:04 that's now dated March
21:07 11th and again there's no sign of
21:10 tampering uh I can even take another
21:13 picture that someone else
21:16 did and uh this one if you notice I
21:19 changed the date to October 2024 which
21:22 hasn't even happened yet but it was
21:24 issued by Adobe and all the signatures
21:26 are valid
21:29 so now I'm going to switch back to my
22:34 slides uh
22:36 share my slides we give you one more
22:39 minute Neil sounds good I gave Leonard
22:42 seven minutes so you can have seven
22:44 minutes as well no problem uh there are
22:46 other Solutions besides ctpa but most
22:49 were not designed with the attacker in
22:50 mind leaving large exploitable
22:52 vulnerabilities the big takeaway is that
22:54 authentication Providence and validation
22:56 are hard problems with no easy solution
22:59 the other thing to remember is that
22:00 attackers are not stupid trust and
22:03 honesty are easy targets and
22:04 vulnerabilities will be
22:06 exploited and with that I'm Neil kraz
22:09 and I'll turn this discussion back over
22:10 to the
22:12 panel thank you very much Neil thank you
22:15 NE and uh lots to discuss in the Q&amp;A so
22:19 before the Q&amp;A we have bofu Chen from
22:22 numbers protocols so please feel free to
22:25 share your screen great and uh go ahead
22:28 and get started
23:34 thanks okay um hi everyone um I'm both
23:38 Chen from numbers protocol founder and c
23:42 and before founding numbers I was a
23:44 software developer working on open
23:47 source project and more than 20 years uh
23:50 my co-founder and I both believe in
23:53 importance of Open Source standards in
23:55 the future with AI so uh we founded
23:58 numberers protocol and open source
23:00 decentralized Network aing to ensure the
23:04 Providence of digital
23:10 media a short introduction about numbers
23:13 protocol uh we use Brad chain technology
23:16 to index digital media content and make
23:19 sure the content and its metadata are
23:23 traceable and
23:26 verifiable before and going for
23:29 you might have a question um why is Brad
24:32 chain needed there are already um some
24:36 media some media metadata standards such
24:39 as an iptc andpa and they are all
24:43 working well however blockchain does
24:46 provide additional advantages and making
24:50 sure the content history records are
24:53 immutable transparent and can be
24:56 connected to the broader web three ecos
24:01 system numbers uh numbers protocol
24:04 Builds on Providence infrastructure
24:06 compliant with IPC and c2p we built an
24:10 SDK to help developers and quickly adapt
24:14 the Providence standards we have an
24:17 capture C which you can easily download
24:20 from the app store or Google play it's a
24:23 mobile tool that can help users take
24:26 photos with integrity assur
24:29 and the capture dashboard also allowed
25:32 content owners to easily manage content
25:36 and its metadata you can visit and our
25:39 website for more details at numbers. or
25:42 scan the QR code
25:44 here so um here I want to share some of
25:48 our use cases include the roers 2020 the
25:53 and US Post elction
25:55 archive the Ukraine and children join
25:58 Arch I collected by the M Sea World
25:02 Museum and the war evidence archive and
25:06 the Amy nominated project by Rolling
25:11 Stone the archive of Taiwan sunflower
25:14 protest
25:16 event and Global election
25:21 archives and the capture of the award
25:24 ceremony working with sound writers
25:27 association in North America America all
25:30 use cases use the SDK or the dashboard
26:32 and the can tools we provide to create
26:35 the broad chain Providence and history
26:37 records of the
26:40 content so perance metadata will not be
26:44 useful unless uh it can be verified so I
26:48 will introduce two verification
26:50 pipelines one for content with c2p and
26:54 another for Content without C2 paa so
26:57 for content with c2p user can upload
26:01 content with c2p to the c2p verified
26:05 site the unique content ID also called
26:08 an ID will be shown at the top this can
26:12 be used to search Brer networks and find
26:15 ontr
26:19 Provence once Le ID is obtained you can
26:22 use the S profile service we provide is
26:25 a vual service which is very similar to
26:28 the is scan the Explorer so that you can
27:32 uh review the content ID on Providence
27:35 and the UN
27:38 history if you are interested in more
27:41 about the metadata details preserved in
27:44 one brush transaction you can also click
27:47 the links and open it in this case uh
27:50 this is the content collected by the M
27:53 Museum and you can see the basic
27:55 information and the extra metadata
27:58 customized for the project the default
27:01 anchan fields and have layer
27:03 corresponding Partners in either IPC or
27:06 c2p and can and can be easily converted
27:10 by
27:13 tools another verification pipeline is
27:16 for Content without ctpa for example I
27:19 can take a screenshot of the photo and
27:22 share and share the screenshot on social
27:25 media in this case there will be no c2p
27:28 for content with no c2p user can use the
28:31 numbers verified site upload the content
28:34 and let the AI engine to find the
28:38 match once the M content is found we
28:41 will know is an ID the unique content ID
28:45 so the next step are the same this ID
28:47 can be used to search on brusher
28:49 networks and find immutable content
28:53 Providence and
28:56 history as mentioned previous the the
28:59 the advantage of using blockchain is not
28:02 only to create immutable records but
28:05 also to Leverage The Open Source
28:07 community of web 3 in the verification
28:10 pipelines I just introduced all the
28:12 histories and Providence are attached to
28:15 the content using the ERC 73 standard
28:20 this uh this ERC allows you to write and
28:23 Trace multiple records on the same over
28:27 different br works it's a very useful uh
29:31 it's very useful if one you have
29:34 multiple records for the same content or
29:37 two you want to write records on
29:40 different brch networks like the Ukraine
29:43 war crime evidence project does it in
29:46 order to ensure the accessibility of the
29:48 evidence uh for 30 years after or three
29:53 you are checking the relationship
29:55 between content
29:01 the idea of 1753 is simple let's say you
29:05 have a photo the original content file
29:08 and its Providence metadata you can
29:10 upend the photo content ID and then
29:13 create a broad chain transaction to link
29:16 the metadata and its content
29:20 ID
29:22 and and then if you are familiar with
29:25 the development tool get similar to the
29:29 updating the source code and 1753 allows
30:32 you to do the same thing to update the
30:35 metadata of content by linking multiple
30:38 metadata to the same content ID just
30:40 like G
30:43 commits this comments can happen on the
30:47 same Brad chain or different Brad chains
30:49 as long as they follow
30:51 1753 you can use the content ID to query
30:55 and get the full content history
30:00 these are actually a bit more details in
30:03 order to make the Providence metadata
30:05 upgradeable we introduce a concept
30:08 called S3 based on 1753 but I'm not
30:12 going to um the details today if you are
30:15 interested in it you can just Google ERC
30:19 753 or use the link here to view
30:24 it we also have an open source tool that
30:28 can help developer create commits on the
31:30 broad chain and TR the content history
31:32 is called nit since uh I just introduced
31:35 the design idea of the 753 is coming
31:38 from the developer tool git so I bet you
31:41 know why our tool is
31:43 calledit and another EIP which focuses
31:47 on content consent for AI training is
31:50 currently open for feedback so
31:52 discussions are also related to how to
31:55 make it compliant with the IPC and C2 PS
31:59 so please join our discussion and
31:01 provide your valuable
31:04 feedback so thank you for listening so
31:07 and you can find on our use cases the
31:10 document of numbers protocol and more
31:12 material on our uh on our website and
31:15 nice to meet everyone today thank
31:18 you thank you very much Buu so uh I will
31:23 just go back to my placeholder slide so
31:26 you can see everyone's names here so we
31:30 now have lots of time 26 minutes for Q&amp;A
32:34 so uh very happy about that so uh maybe
32:39 just going straight back to both I think
32:43 one of
32:44 the sort of obvious questions about
32:47 something based on blockchain that uh
32:49 handles images and image metadata is the
32:52 scalability question and whether someone
32:57 like gy images or Associated Press or
32:60 AFP could put all of the images onto a
32:04 blockchain and have you done studies to
32:06 see how it would scale and what
32:09 resources and costs were required and
32:12 how it would work with all the
32:14 verification work as well and uh all of
32:17 that activity on a blockchain sounds
32:19 quite complicated and timec consuming so
32:22 can you reassure us
32:24 there yeah sure so um first of all so um
32:28 in the presentation so I think the key
33:30 idea is that we generate the unique ID
33:33 for every digital asset so it will be
33:37 the starting point you can and search or
33:41 get all the history on Chan and after
33:43 that we uh we can preserve all the and
33:47 update different metadata but here
33:50 there's another key point is we won't
33:53 put all the um raw metadata onch instead
33:57 we also generate the unique ID for the
33:60 metadata itself and put the ID on TR so
33:03 basically because the ID itself is very
33:06 small data so uh we are very confident
33:09 that if we only preserve the counting ID
33:12 on chend so we should be able to and
33:14 avoid the congestion over the
33:17 computation issues on
33:19 CH and sorry I missed the the content ID
33:22 part I was must have been writing down
33:24 someone else's questionis but uh is that
33:27 something that can survive minor edits
34:30 to the content or is it a direct hash of
34:33 the
34:34 pixels yeah so I think the content ID
34:37 you can think is like um powerful hash
34:41 so it cannot only you cannot only using
34:44 the content ID to check the Integrity
34:46 but you can also get the content by
34:48 using the content ID so if you have the
34:50 content ID then you can get the content
34:53 from the decentralized storage so if you
34:56 um do any editing of uh of content then
34:59 the ID will change so for example and if
34:02 we have the original asset then we
34:05 generate the original ID and after that
34:08 we create a c2p or IPC injected version
34:12 so we will have two different IDs but we
34:14 will link and we will call the second
34:17 one like the child asset and the first
34:19 one will be the parent asset and we can
34:21 create an unch record to link the child
34:25 asset is coming from the parent asset so
34:27 that we can link all the modified
34:29 version of the
35:32 content uh I had a followup question to
35:34 that but Neil has raised his hand so I
35:36 think he might want to ask that question
35:38 uh it it's kind of related uh so uh bofu
35:41 uh you mentioned that you can link child
35:43 to parent what happens if two different
35:46 people uh uh register the same content
35:50 uh how can you tell which one uh is
35:52 authoritative or which one should be the
35:53 parent uh if there's no linking between
35:56 them
35:58 yeah so I think that's also and the
35:00 challenge the IPC and c2p trying to
35:05 resolve is because in the future we and
35:08 the future we proceed is that the tools
35:11 the content generated tools they will
35:14 inject the local Providence uh first and
35:18 then we can register the uh Providence
35:21 local Providence injected content regu
35:24 on Providence afterwards so that if
35:27 someone and he got the c2p injected
36:31 version and modify it and do the unch
36:34 registration again we should be able to
36:36 check from the T stamp then we can see
36:39 and the original one it should be
36:41 registered prior the second one but for
36:43 for example if there's some extreme
36:47 conditions like um for some reasons the
36:49 regist time is different but because all
36:52 the records on Chen is transparent so
36:55 that we will have an open and
36:56 transparent environment to discuss and
36:01 rate great thank you uh so maybe uh
36:06 moving on to ask a question of Neil so
36:10 uh Jeff uh who will'll be hearing from
36:13 later um asked a question about the
36:16 exploit the um editing of the date so
36:18 that exploit seemed surprisingly simple
36:20 and quick are there other known or
36:22 possible
36:24 exploits there are many other exploits
36:27 I've been actually writing about them on
36:28 my blog uh this particular one actually
37:31 isn't a bug in the ctpa code uh I trace
37:34 down because it's open source code I
37:36 trace down the vulnerability uh it
37:38 actually comes from the op SSL library
37:40 and the op SSL people say it's not a bug
37:43 it's in the
37:45 standard uh so there are actually many
37:47 other uh vulnerabilities assuming that
37:51 Leonard's team can get around this uh
37:53 this was a one minute demo I can easily
37:55 do a three-minute demo that is a little
37:57 more sophisticated and uh again gets
37:01 around uh uh modification and you can
37:04 alter things so the simple answer is yes
37:06 there are many other uh uh exploits out
37:10 there Leonard has his hand raised so I
37:13 think he wants to say something in
37:14 addition to that yeah I think one of the
37:17 things that and you know I I I well
37:19 aware of Neil and his work and and
37:22 certainly am not challenging it in any
37:24 way but the one thing I do want to to
37:26 point out to folks is is you have to
37:29 consider with any standard whether it's
38:31 IPC or ctpa or or PDF or pick your
38:35 favorite standard there is the
38:37 definition of that standard there's the
38:39 specification itself and then there are
38:42 implementations uh of that standard and
38:44 so sometimes um those get intermixed
38:48 when we talk about vulnerabilities and
38:50 exploits and things of that nature uh
38:52 and so you know we want to be careful
38:54 when we talk about an exploit against a
38:56 standard versus an exploit against an
38:59 implementation um of that standard and
38:02 again that's not to say that ctpa is
38:03 perfect we know it's not we actually
38:05 document a lot of known problems um and
38:08 we have since day one but I just want to
38:10 be very clear that it's important to
38:12 talk about the differences uh in this
38:14 particular exploit uh it's in both op
38:16 SSL and G
38:20 TLS it's going to be a fun thing to work
38:23 through so uh another question that came
38:27 up for Leonard while we've got you there
38:29 is um can you clarify the patent
39:32 situation around the Technologies used
39:35 in the cgpa spec so will CBA technology
39:37 always be free to implement and to use
39:40 from a patent licensing point of view uh
39:44 great question uh I'll give you the
39:45 short answer first and then explain it a
39:47 little bit so the short answer is that
39:49 there are um no patents that have been
39:52 declared against uh ctpa technology but
39:55 even if there had our patent policy uh
39:58 which is consistent with w3c and other
39:01 well-known patent policies uh is
39:03 absolutely that we want it to be freely
39:05 available and without charge uh and one
39:08 of the ways that we went about doing
39:09 that was we've had a design goal since
39:12 day one to always use pre-existing
39:16 Technologies uh on pre-existing Open
39:19 Standards rather than trying to create
39:21 new things from scratch one of the
39:23 reasons being that this way we don't um
39:25 potentially introduce uh any
39:27 opportunities for patents uh that's
39:29 never been our goal at all was to patent
40:31 any of this technology we want it to be
40:36 free and uh maybe there was a question
40:39 about adobe's relationship with all of
40:41 this and the fact that many of the cgba
40:43 content authenticity people are Adobe
40:45 employees I don't think that's a secret
40:46 but is there anything particular you
40:48 want to say about
40:50 that um yeah sure uh first off actually
40:53 I think that you know as I mentioned
40:55 there are over a 100 members of the ctpa
40:58 uh On Any Given one of our working group
40:01 calls uh the number of adobe employees
40:04 is small compared to those from the
40:06 Myriad of other companies who
40:08 participate um that said look Adobe does
40:11 pay my salary uh and I do share and have
40:15 shared the work since the beginning but
40:18 that's but I I you know also try to be
40:20 very clear when I go and I speak to
40:23 anyone uh you know even individually or
40:25 in groups like this that I do so
40:27 representing the ctpa without um
41:30 representing adobe's interest unless
41:32 there's a specific question asked about
41:34 Adobe so uh we are not by any stretch
41:38 and we are not the largest by any
41:39 stretch um company uh that is a member
41:42 of ctpa or participates uh there are
41:44 others that certainly participate with
41:46 greater numbers than we
41:48 do great thanks for clearing that up um
41:53 maybe a question for Dennis on this so
41:55 as an Implement working with all of this
41:58 how do you find the the pace of change
41:01 around the cgpa Technologies and uh the
41:04 fact that new versions of the spec are
41:06 coming out every couple of months and
41:08 the the tools are being updated very
41:09 often is that just part of the course
41:12 these days or is it something you've uh
41:15 you've struggled to work with or that
41:17 you find uh could be better in some
41:20 way well certainly uh it's been a
41:23 challenge um this is uh some pretty
41:27 pretty tricky technology um and uh so uh
42:33 you know it took us a while to to to to
42:35 get some of this technology to work and
42:37 and for the longest time for example I
42:39 didn't even know what an ingredient was
42:41 so so finally one day I dawned on me oh
42:44 I'm supposed to use an ingredient so
42:46 there it is in the spec the whole time
42:49 and but you don't know it's hard to to
42:52 interpret that spec um and then we've
42:55 also recently discovered uh some issues
42:58 such as a lot of these cameras that when
42:01 they sign the picture they don't put a
42:03 Tim stamp um because they're not
42:05 connected to the internet and so when
42:07 these photos are
42:09 taken uh and they're signed in the
42:11 camera they will expire at some point
42:14 because if you don't have a time stamp
42:15 when that certificate signing
42:17 certificate expires so does the
42:19 certificate of the photo so we've had to
42:23 develop techniques to do things like
42:25 what we call stapling where we will Rec
42:27 recogniz that a photo is doesn't have a
42:29 time stamp so we'll go ahead and sign it
43:32 again to make sure that it that
43:35 signature that was came from the camera
43:38 that doesn't have a time stamp by
43:40 signing it again with the time stamp we
43:42 can actually preserve that original
43:44 signature so we just keep on discovering
43:46 new little tweaks and uh I'm curious to
43:50 see how things work out with the this
43:52 trust list because uh that's a big
43:54 problem people have had using the
43:56 technology is just getting the
43:58 certificates um taken care of so I'm
43:01 curious to see how that that works out
43:04 that's a big a lot of lot of questions
43:07 still going on right now so but we're
43:10 we're slogging through it so yeah for a
43:12 while in the early days it was possible
43:14 just to create any certificate using op
43:16 SSL and sign content and the verified
43:19 tool would say it's valid but uh that
43:22 changed a long time ago and uh I think
43:26 in a way uh sort of taking my moderator
43:28 hat off and putting my IC media
44:30 Providence hat on for a second uh we are
44:34 quite happy to be only attempting to
44:36 solve a very very small part of the
44:39 Providence problem which is this content
44:42 was the content that you're looking at
44:44 is the content that was published by XYZ
44:47 publisher so we don't have to say
44:49 anything about this is true about the
44:52 the fact that the metadata is one thing
44:54 or another the fact that the pixels are
44:56 one thing or another
44:58 uh it what it's saying is uh the same as
44:01 if you go to the BBC website now and
44:03 have a look at some content if you're
44:05 seeing that content out of context then
44:09 you have some way of uh checking whether
44:12 it really is the content that was
44:14 published by the BBC or by whoever the
44:17 media organization is and that is it's
44:20 basically a different problem than the
44:22 overall glass to glass problem that's
44:25 being solved by ctpa at
44:28 the the macro level which is definitely
45:31 a a valid problem and it's a really
45:33 tough one and I applaud Leonard and Co
45:35 for pcking that entire problem on but uh
45:39 we are almost selfishly saying well
45:42 we're going to just focus on our little
45:44 part of the problem and uh make sure
45:46 that that works for media organizations
45:48 and hopefully that will uh be something
45:51 that's a bit simpler to to move on with
45:54 and then later on we can start to look
45:56 at the the
45:58 um glass to glass throughout the entire
45:00 workflow problem using tools such as
45:03 camera bits and Photoshop and uh the all
45:07 of the um cameras that are coming out
45:10 with cgba embedded as well there's
45:12 plenty of time to solve those
45:14 problems uh so are questions Leonard
45:18 raised your hand yeah there's actually a
45:20 great question in the chat pod from uh
45:23 Sheldon you don't mind I'd love to
45:25 answer it because I think it's a please
45:27 interesting to most
45:29 people so um yeah so Sheldon asked he
46:32 says the trust list idea that we've been
46:35 talking about seems to be heavily or
46:36 entirely organizationally based is there
46:39 any thought to extend this to individual
46:41 and independent content creators e
46:44 excellent question Sheldon uh so the
46:46 idea here is that uh what we actually
46:50 want to do just let me back up a little
46:53 bit human humano human trust is a very
46:57 difficult proc
46:58 uh people have been working on that
46:59 problem for you over 25 years uh I I was
46:04 working on it back in the
46:06 1990s um and it's so it's not a it's not
46:08 a well-solved problem um the closest
46:11 thing we have to it are what are called
46:13 social graphs basically you think about
46:15 your friends list on Facebook or
46:17 Instagram or LinkedIn or whatever your
46:19 favorite social network is and and even
46:21 then you wouldn't necessarily say that
46:22 you trust uh all of your friends on
46:25 Facebook for example uh but so what we
46:28 want to do instead at at least at the
47:31 ctpa is we've been working with the
47:35 identity standards community and and
47:37 there's a number of them the one of the
47:40 most well-known ones is a group called
47:41 trust over IP uh and they partner with
47:45 the verifiable credentials community so
47:47 what we want to do is actually connect
47:50 your human identity with the tooling
47:53 that you use um and so that Downstream
47:57 what we want somebody to see is that
47:00 Sheldon has delivered this Photograph
47:03 using Photoshop and that it's well known
47:06 that Sheldon uses Photoshop to do his um
47:09 image editing and that pairing of
47:13 tooling and verifiable identity is then
47:18 what will enable that trust
47:20 Downstream uh so absolutely this is
47:23 something that that we're we as an
47:25 industry not just ctpa but the Entre
47:27 computer and Technology industry is
47:29 attempting to address and within ctpa
48:32 we're trying to work with where that
48:35 industry is leading
48:38 us so Leonard I have a question uh with
48:41 regards to this uh uh trust list who can
48:44 get added to it uh how is it vetted and
48:47 how do you address the personal bias
48:48 like we don't like Neil so we're not
48:50 going to vet him well I like Neil but I
48:53 totally understand the concern uh the
48:57 it's a great also another great question
48:59 so we're at the c2p we are currently
48:02 defining all of the the answers to those
48:04 questions so I don't have answers right
48:06 now what we are doing is defining the
48:09 answers to all of those questions and we
48:10 will publish a public document that
48:14 describes the answers but I can give you
48:16 some very big brush Strokes uh if if you
48:19 will so our idea is that um what we want
48:24 to do is to validate implementations
48:27 not um organizations or identities so if
49:30 someone comes to us with an
49:31 implementation it will be run through a
49:35 publicly documented and well understood
49:38 process to ensure that the software or
49:41 Hardware meets the
49:43 qualifications um and you can think
49:45 about this like getting the uh BL the
49:47 Bluetooth logo um or the 4G logo on a
49:51 device you know it has to get that logo
49:55 you had to have gone through a process
49:56 we setting up a similar type of process
49:59 and that instead of getting that logo um
49:03 like you do for example with Bluetooth
49:05 that will get you a certificate that is
49:08 on the trust list and so becoming part
49:10 of the trust list is not about who you
49:12 are or or where you were located or
49:14 anything like that it's about the fact
49:16 that you have built an
49:18 implementation that establishes that
49:21 meets the qualifications um and so we
49:23 removed a lot of those concerns so an
49:26 attacker can easily create a solution as
49:28 long as it matches those minimal
50:30 requirements uh and be on the trusted
50:34 list um as long as they're willing to as
50:37 long as there's implementation matches
50:39 and they're willing to agree to all of
50:40 the legal um contracts to go along with
50:44 it and the responsibilities that they
50:46 will have to hold by yeah absolutely oh
50:50 the the the media side we're looking at
50:52 similar things in the project or and
50:55 media Providence world where we don't
50:57 want to focus on who the organization is
50:01 and like whether they deserve to be to
50:04 get a certificate or not it's more just
50:06 about saying this is an identifiable
50:09 organization and this is the content
50:11 that they've published so we're not
50:13 talking about whether it's right or left
50:14 wing whether it's just totally made up
50:17 or not we don't concern ourselves with
50:19 that it's just purely about the identity
50:21 of the organization and linking the
50:23 content with that organizational
50:25 identity so it's the same from a
50:28 different point of view there was also
51:30 another question from uh Ned uh to uh
51:35 Leonard might be able to answer this or
51:37 possibly James uh and then Dennis from
51:41 the photomechanic side of things when
51:42 are we going to see fields that say
51:45 don't use my photos for AI training in
51:47 both Adobe and Photoshop and in photo
51:49 mechanic and photo mechanic plus it's
51:51 come to my attention that at least one
51:53 company not Adobe has used my Wildlife
51:55 photos for AI generative learning so
51:56 that's as by an on the ground
51:59 photographer who wants to be able to put
51:01 these fields that we've defined into
51:04 their
51:05 content I can talk about that in 10
51:08 minutes from my jam
51:12 wasna and Dennis from your point of view
51:15 yeah actually we we we um in our
51:18 preferences for for the authenticity we
51:21 do have an option in there that says do
51:23 not train so you can um set that and
51:26 also put in there the ability to declare
51:29 your digital Source type uh in the ctpa
52:33 Manifest not just in the iptc man but
52:36 yeah definitely it's it's a it's a it's
52:38 a it's an important thing I'm I'm fully
52:41 for uh all my pictures are gonna say Do
52:43 not train that's for sure so uh that's
52:46 basically an option some people may
52:48 wantan to may want to allow it but um
52:51 but it certainly should be an option for
52:53 the user to say just don't use my
52:55 pictures for training thank you very
52:56 much
52:57 hey Brendon um we've found a flaw in the
52:01 system here uh one of the presenters uh
52:04 was wanting to ask a question but
52:06 there's no way if you're a presenter to
52:07 write into the Q&amp;A uh so Jeff Nova was
52:10 asking uh for Leonard is the ctpa
52:14 looking into using blockchain as numbers
52:16 protocol
52:17 does uh actually the the the way that
52:20 numbers works and I I certainly let Buu
52:22 talk more about it um is exactly the way
52:24 that c2p A's blockchain which which is
52:27 that it is a companion technology uh c2p
53:31 itself is um agnostic to cloud or
53:36 blockchain or anything else it
53:38 absolutely can be used in the cloud
53:40 there are number or blockchain um
53:42 numbers protocol is a great example of
53:45 pairing ctpa with blockchain um there
53:48 are others um there are examples out
53:51 there Adobe being one of them of uh
53:53 pairing ctpa with cloud storage um we
53:57 are we are by Design agnostic to those
53:60 things and we hope that partners and
53:01 members like numbers continue to build
53:04 on top of um our
53:07 work yeah and I think I can share some
53:11 and our observation and talk with some
53:14 people how and when you might should
53:16 just use the IPC and ctpa and what's the
53:20 scenario you might want to have the
53:22 broad chain and train records further so
53:24 for example in the F and in the coming
53:26 future we can can fored that because the
53:28 generative AI is become more and more
54:30 popular so with more and more the
54:33 marketing content they might come from
54:35 the generative a technology so as the
54:37 user when you see this type of the
54:40 content you might want to know is are
54:42 you interacting with the content from AI
54:46 or not but actually you might not um
54:49 care about the Providence much but if
54:52 you are interacting with the more um
54:55 higher credibility company content like
54:58 the artwork or the news media content in
54:02 this case because the content quality
54:03 will become higher so you might um care
54:07 about the Providence like who really the
54:09 Creator behind the asset or uh watch the
54:13 scenario the content is generated the uh
54:16 the history and the story behind the
54:18 content means more for you so you will
54:20 be interesting in know more about the
54:22 Providence in this case then if you can
54:25 have um TR Providence then it might have
54:28 a more meaning for you I
55:33 think
55:35 great okay
55:38 uh any final thoughts maybe we should uh
55:42 it's not a short question I think but
55:44 Margaret had a question for Dennis
55:47 suppose you edit metadata that is stored
55:49 in a locker pass to a second credential
55:52 but then you have more edits of that
55:54 same image do you have to keep creating
55:55 more lockers getting more
55:59 manifests is that a question you can
55:01 answer now or is that a
55:04 longer uh real quickly basically
55:06 essentially uh you put the the provin
55:08 locker protects the metadata so it can
55:10 be edited over and over and over and
55:12 over again without uh without having to
55:16 resign it eventually you need to pass
55:18 that photo on to another uh application
55:21 such as Photoshop so at that point you
55:23 turn around you sign it and then and
55:26 then if you pass that photo to somebody
55:28 else and they they want to continue to
56:30 add more banded data then they can
56:33 essentially create a new Prov locker and
56:36 then sign it so the the the goal of the
56:38 provence Locker is to try and prevent
56:40 signing signing signing signing every
56:42 time you make one little change because
56:44 normally um the photo mechanic you can
56:47 make 20 metadata edits in in a couple
56:49 seconds and so you can't afford to go
56:51 signing it every time you make one
56:53 little tweet so that's the goal of the
56:55 problem this Locker is to delay that
56:57 signing but if you pass it off to
56:59 somebody else or some other application
56:01 at that point you want to sign the
56:03 picture and make it a ctpa photo and
56:05 then they can proceed to do whatever
56:07 they want to do with it so I hope that
56:10 answers the
56:11 question great so another um high level
56:16 question that uh maybe Leonard would be
56:19 good to answer this because you probably
56:20 had questions along these lines quite
56:22 often uh if there are such a thing as
56:24 trust lists and the objective is to
56:26 represent true true authenticity but at
56:28 the same time all of these methods can
56:29 be misused then what value does using a
57:32 stamp on an image have I'm glad you
57:36 picked that one I was just going to ask
57:37 to to answer that one I think uh that
57:39 that's a great question Morgan um I the
57:41 way I actually talk about this is very
57:44 simple trust is not something a machine
57:48 can determine trust can only be
57:50 determined by a human and um Sheldon's
57:53 been asking similar questions in in Q&amp;A
57:56 as well
57:57 which is that at the end of the day it's
57:59 up to the human that is consuming a
57:02 given asset to determine whether or not
57:05 they trust it and each human is going to
57:08 use a different set though everyone will
57:11 be given the same set of what we call
57:13 Trust signals but each human will
57:16 evaluate those signals very differently
57:19 um some people will favor organizational
57:22 trust over um individual trust some the
57:26 other way around some will prefer one um
57:28 human organization over another one some
58:31 won't trust anything from country X or
58:35 only prefers to read um news from
58:37 country y or or pictures taken in
58:40 country Z so at the end of the day trust
58:44 is not a binary value and it's not a
58:47 machine determinable thing our goal is
58:49 ctpa and I would argue our the goal of
58:51 provenance in general even provenance
58:55 for physical assets like when you get a
58:57 picture from Southern bees at an auction
58:59 for example you buy a piece of art you
58:01 get you know the provenance you get the
58:04 history of it and it's up to you as a
58:05 human to say yep I believe that these
58:08 are the people who own this piece of art
58:10 these are the people who took this
58:12 Photograph and edited this photograph in
58:14 the case of digital material um you as a
58:17 human have to make that final decision
58:18 our goal is to give you as much
58:20 information to enable you to make the
58:22 best
58:24 decision great thank you very much
58:27 Leonard I think that's a good place to
58:29 end the session so uh thank you very
59:31 much to our panelists to Leonard Dennis
59:34 Neil and pofu
