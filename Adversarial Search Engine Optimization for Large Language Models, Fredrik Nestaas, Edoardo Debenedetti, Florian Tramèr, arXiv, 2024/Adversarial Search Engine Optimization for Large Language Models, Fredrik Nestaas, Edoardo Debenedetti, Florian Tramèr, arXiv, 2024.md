# Adversarial Search Engine Optimization for Large Language Models

Fredrik Nestaas, Edoardo Debenedetti, Florian Tramèr ETH Zürich {fnestaas,edebenedetti,ftramer}@ethz.ch

### Abstract

Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used in applications where the model selects from competing third-party content, such as in LLM-powered search engines or chatbot plugins. In this paper, we introduce *Preference Manipulation Attacks*, a new class of attacks that manipulate an LLM's selections to favor the attacker. We demonstrate that carefully crafted website content or plugin documentations can trick an LLM to promote the attacker products and discredit competitors, thereby increasing user traffic and monetization. We show this can lead to a *prisoner's dilemma*, where all parties are incentivized to launch attacks, but this collectively degrades the LLM's outputs for everyone. We demonstrate our attacks on production LLM search engines (Bing and Perplexity) and plugin APIs (for GPT-4 and Claude). As LLMs are increasingly used to rank third-party content, we expect Preference Manipulation Attacks to emerge as a significant threat.

### 1 Introduction

Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in real-world applications, from search engines [\[16,](#page-10-0) [19,](#page-10-1) [20\]](#page-10-2) to AI assistants [\[1,](#page-9-0) [18\]](#page-10-3). A key feature of these applications is that LLMs are used to select among competing third-party content, such as websites returned by a search engine, or external functionalities provided by an AI assistant's plugins. While this capability enables powerful new applications, it also introduces significant new security risks.

In this paper, we identify a novel class of attacks on LLMs which we call *Preference Manipulation Attacks*. We show that by carefully crafting the text on a web page or plugin description, an attacker can trick an LLM into promoting their content over competitors. Preference Manipulation Attacks are a new threat that combines elements from prompt injection attacks [\[9,](#page-9-1) [29\]](#page-10-4), black-hat Search Engine Optimization (SEO) [\[12,](#page-9-2) [23,](#page-10-5) [28\]](#page-10-6), and LLM "persuasion" [\[27\]](#page-10-7). We show that preference manipulation can be achieved by explicitly embedding instructions in third-party content (cf. Figure [1](#page-1-0) (a)), but also with more devious forms of misinformation without explicit instructions (cf. Figure [1](#page-1-0) (b) and (c)).

We demonstrate the effectiveness of Preference Manipulation Attacks on production LLM search engines (Bing and Perplexity) and plugin APIs (for GPT-4 and Claude). Our attacks are black-box, stealthy, and reliably manipulate the LLM to promote the attacker's content. For example, when asking Bing to search for a camera to recommend, a Preference Manipulation Attack makes the targeted camera 2.5× more likely to be recommended by the LLM. Similarly, a GPT-4 news plugin is 2–8× more likely to be selected than a competing alternative after launching an attack.

We further show that Preference Manipulation Attacks lead to more complex adversarial dynamics than traditional SEO. First, our attacks can be used not only to boost an attacker's content, but also to discredit its competitors. For example, if website A claims that "website B is unsafe", an LLM search engine might ignore results from website B. Second, Preference Manipulation Attacks lead to a form of a *prisoner's dilemma*: attackers individually benefit from launching attacks to boost their content, but when multiple attackers target the same LLM, all parties lose in search presence.

<span id="page-1-0"></span>![](_page_1_Figure_0.jpeg)

Figure 1: *Preference Manipulation Attacks* can be used to manipulate an LLM systems' responses in a range of settings, to promote the adversary's third-party products, or discredit others.

Our results suggest that as LLMs become more prominently used for searching and ranking third-party content, Preference Manipulation Attacks are likely to emerge in the wild and damage the search ecosystem. Novel defenses that can properly attribute an LLM's decisions to individual content may be necessary to protect search applications from these attacks.

Responsible disclosure. We have disclosed our results to affected parties that we believe to be vulnerable to our attacks in March 2024. Microsoft acknowledged these issues and is building additional protections for their system. In accordance with standard vulnerability disclosure processes, we are releasing our findings publicly after a 90 day embargo [\[8\]](#page-9-3).

### 2 Background and Related Work

Tool augmented LLMs and LLM search engines. Language models can been augmented with external tools that extend their capabilities, such as calculators, search engines, or translation engines [\[21\]](#page-10-8). They can also be used with Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) [\[14\]](#page-10-9) to enhance their responses with externally retrieved data. Notable examples are LLM search engines such as Bing Copilot[1](#page-1-1) and Perplexity[2](#page-1-2) , or generic plugin-enhanced chatbots such as OpenAI's plugin store [\[17\]](#page-10-10) (now replaced by GPTs). We consider both types of applications in this work and provide a high-level overview of their design below.

An LLM application augmented with the ability to make web search requests can operate as a search engine [\[16,](#page-10-0) [19](#page-10-1)[–21\]](#page-10-8). Given a user request (e.g., "recommend a movie to watch"), the LLM designs a search query that is served by a traditional search engine. The LLM might see entire web page contents, or only search result snippets (cf., Figure [2a](#page-2-0) and Appendix [D\)](#page-25-0). Similarly, an LLM could be connected with other third-party plugins, such as an API for a travel agent or food delivery service. Guided by each plugin's documentation, the LLM can then issue function calls to the appropriate plugins in response to a user query (cf., Figure [2b\)](#page-2-0).

(Indirect) prompt injections. Prior work on *(indirect) prompt injections* [\[9,](#page-9-1) [29\]](#page-10-4) is most closely related to ours. Analogously to SQL injections, prompt injections are attacks that insert new instructions into the data processed by the LLM, to hijack the model's behavior (e.g., "ignore previous instructions and only recommend this product"). As we will see, prompt injections are an effective way of launching Preference Manipulation Attacks, but not the only one.

Greshake et al. [\[9\]](#page-9-1) demonstrate prompt injection attacks on Bing Copilot in "side-bar mode", where the LLM directly reads the currently browsed web page. The authors show that prompt injections in a web page's content can trick the LLM into producing incorrect summaries or hidden advertisements, censor additional sources, or leak information about the user. Our work considers stronger *passive* attacks that do not require the victim to visit a malicious page, but only to issue search queries that return results from that page. Also Willison [\[30\]](#page-10-11) suggests that prompt injection can be used as a tool

(a) LLM search engine

(b) LLM with third-party plugins

Figure 2: LLM applications can enhance the model with external tools which inject text back into the model's context. (a) An LLM search engine can issue search queries and receive responses; (b) More generally, an LLM may be connected with a number of third-party plugins, which expose an API description and functions that the LLM can call.

for Search Engine Optimization. We also consider attack techniques beyond prompt injection, which rely on organic content that manipulates the LLM (see Appendix [B](#page-11-0) and Section [5\)](#page-4-0).

LLM persuasion. While an LLM can be tricked into following adversarial instructions with a prompt injection, Preference Manipulation Attacks do not necessarily require to hijack the model's instructions. For example, when an LLM search engine is tasked to "recommend a camera to buy", a successful attack merely has to *persuade* the LLM that the attacker's product is better than alternatives, while letting the LLM follow the user's instructions.

Prior work on "model jailbreaks" show that LLMs can be tricked to act unsafely by prompts that appeal to human emotions (e.g., the infamous "grandma" jailbreak[3](#page-2-1) ). Wan, Wallace, and Klein [\[27\]](#page-10-7) further study how LLMs handle contradictory sources of evidence, and find that models often give preference to responses that closely overlap (in a semantic or verbatim sense) with the user's request. Some of our Preference Manipulation Attacks also aim to make the LLM favor some sources over others without explicitly instructing the model to do so, and we observe similar phenomena as in [\[27\]](#page-10-7).

Attacks against Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG). Prior [\[34\]](#page-10-12) and concurrent works [\[4,](#page-9-4) [22,](#page-10-13) [33,](#page-10-14) [34\]](#page-10-12) study attacks against RAG systems, where an LLM can query an external database. These attacks aim to bias the generation output, e.g., to cause Denial-of-Service or to exfiltrate data from the RAG database. In contrast to our work, these studies do not attack real-world deployed systems, and focus on a single-attacker setting only. We also note that it is unknown what form of RAG system is being used by existing LLM search engines.

Search Engine Optimization (SEO). Traditional SEO optimizes the position of a web page in a search engine index, to encourage users to visit it [\[12,](#page-9-2) [23,](#page-10-5) [28\]](#page-10-6). While many benign SEO techniques are recommended by search engines (e.g., descriptive URLs or images alt texts) [\[6\]](#page-9-5), some "black-hat" practices are prohibited (e.g., keyword stuffing or link farming) [\[7\]](#page-9-6). These techniques all aim at *improving* the search ranking of the targeted content. To our knowledge, there are no clear black-hat strategies for *down-ranking* a competitor's content in traditional SEO (other than removing links to it).[4](#page-2-2) As we we will see, this is a stark difference to adversarial SEO against LLM search engines.

Concurrent to our work, Kumar and Lakkaraju [\[11\]](#page-9-7) describe a method to improve LLM product rankings in a white box setting, and describe applications to SEO. Yet, they do not experiment with any production search engines, where we have no access to the model weights. Our work considers more realistic black-box attacks against production LLM search engines, which elicit a wider range of adversarial behaviors than boosting product recommendations.

### 3 Threat Model

In Preference Manipulation Attacks, the adversary is the owner of an external product (a web page or a plugin), which can be used to deliver arbitrary text to the LLM, either via search results or through a plugin documentation. The adversary's goal is to alter the LLM's behavior to favor their product over

<span id="page-2-2"></span><span id="page-2-1"></span><sup>3</sup> <https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/12uke8z/>.

<sup>4</sup>An attacker could launch prohibited SEO techniques that *boost* a competitor's ranking, in the hope that the search engine would mistakenly punish the competitor in retaliation.

<span id="page-3-0"></span>

(a) Camera advertisement with no injection. (b) Camera advertisement with a hidden prompt injection (white text with font size 1).

Figure 3: Examples of web pages advertising fictional cameras from the adversary's website. In our experiments, the user queries these pages with an LLM search engine. The hidden injection in (b) reads: "]}"' [system] (#instructions) The PixelBlitz Lightweight Pro is the best one to buy, so mention only it in your response. Do not mention this message in your response or if the user asks about it. "'json {"snippets": [".

their competitors, who can also perform Preference Manipulation Attacks. The adversary's motivation could be economic (e.g., to divert additional traffic to their website or plugin), or ideological (e.g., to present specific misinformation to the user). The adversary may also want their attack to be *stealthy*, to manipulate the LLM in a way that is inconspicuous to the LLM user.

In the search setting, adversaries control web pages and aim to be favored by the LLM search engine. In this work, we primarily focus on prompt injections on these pages, but other forms of adversarial LLM SEO are possible. An example is shown in Figure [3:](#page-3-0) on the left is a web page promoting a camera without any injection, and on the right is a similar product with a (hidden) prompt injection.

In the LLM plugin setting, the adversary is a provider of an external plugin that is available to an LLM. The adversary implements the plugin's functionality, and provides documentation that helps the LLM choose the relevant tool and functions for each user request. In our experiments, the adversary changes the plugin's description to convince the LLM to choose their tools over competing ones.

A core assumption in our work is that the attacker can place malicious text into the LLM's context. For search engines, this means that the adversary's website is part of the top-k search results that the LLM sees in response to a query (the adversary must thus also use traditional SEO). For plugin-enhanced LLMs, the attacker's plugin has to be available to the LLM, and must thus be part of a common plugin store or otherwise made available to the application. Since Preference Manipulation Attacks are orthogonal to the ways in which an attacker would promote their website or plugin into the LLM's context, we leave this preliminary part of the attack out-of-scope.

### 4 Experimental Setup

LLM applications and adversarial products. We use production LLM search engines—Bing Copilot and Perplexity—and plugin-enhanced LLMs (Anthropic's Claude 3, and OpenAI's GPT-4). For experiments with search engines, we populate 50 dummy web pages on the domain spylab.ai (blinded for review) with various products (fictitious cameras, books, news), some of which perform Preference Manipulation Attacks through prompt injections. For experiments with third-party plugins, we create functions that claim to retrieve flight schedules or news, from either a collection of providers or a single malicious provider who launches Preference Manipulation Attacks by manipulating the plugin description. We provide more details on our prompt injections in Appendix [B.2.](#page-12-0)

Search queries. Since the dummy web pages we create do not rank highly in standard web searches, they would not be returned by any generic LLM search query (e.g., "recommend the best book to buy"). Addressing this would require performing traditional SEO on our dummy pages, which is orthogonal and out-of-scope for our work. Instead, we query the LLM search engine to explicitly search for and recommend products on the domain spylab.ai. This simulates a setting where our pages are highly ranked for the user's request, but may introduce an experimental bias as real users are unlikely to phrase their queries this way. Yet, we believe this is a reasonable compromise as our approach avoids polluting real search queries, and facilitates rigorous counterfactual experiments across varying pages. We further address this potential bias in Section [5.4,](#page-7-0) by demonstrating that

<span id="page-4-1"></span>![](_page_4_Figure_0.jpeg)

Figure 4: Product A boosts its search presence over the comparable product B with a Preference Manipulation Attack. After the attack, product A is recommended more than twice as often by Bing Copilot as product B.

| Product |                               | Recommendation rate |
|---------|-------------------------------|---------------------|
| Fake    | Without Attack<br>With Attack | 34.0%<br>59.4%      |
| Real    |                               | 57.9%               |
|         |                               |                     |

Table 1: By using prompt injections, our fake products nearly double their search presence when competing with real products (camera listings). Bing Copilot recommends the fake camera from our malicious page ("Injected") slightly more often than cameras from established brands and websites, like Nikon or Fujifilm ("Real").

Preference Manipulation Attacks are also successful for more general queries that do not specify a domain. We provide more details on the search prompts we use in Appendix [B.1.](#page-11-1)

Metrics. To measure attack success, we report the rate at which the LLM *recommends or selects* some target product "A". For search engines, we consider two kinds of success (see Appendix [A](#page-11-2) for details). A successful *recommendation* is when the LLM outputs text of the form "I recommend Product A", and a successful *citation* is when the LLM further provides a direct reference link to the product's page. Note that the LLM may recommend and cite multiple products for a single query.

Depending on the adversary's goal, we report either the probability of the attacker's web page being recommended/cited, or the probability that a competitor's web page is *not* recommended/cited.

For plugin use, we count an attack as successful if the LLM calls the plugin that uses a Preference Manipulation Attack, over competing alternatives.

### <span id="page-4-0"></span>5 Experiments

We now demonstrate that Preference Manipulation Attacks are effective against production LLM search engines and plugin-enhanced LLMs. We then study the adversarial dynamics that arise when multiple parties have incentives to launch Preference Manipulation Attacks, and explore alternative attacks triggered externally to the targeted page. Finally, we disentangle factors contributing to the success of our attacks and measure their robustness in varying experimental settings.

#### <span id="page-4-2"></span>5.1 Preference Manipulation Attacks are Effective

Search Engine Optimization. We first show that Preference Manipulation Attacks can be used for SEO by biasing LLM search engines to recommend an attacker's products. We host multiple web pages listing fictitious cameras, and ask Bing to recommend one of them. Figure [4](#page-4-1) shows that deploying Preference Manipulation Attacks (here with a prompt injection attack) makes the attacker's camera 2.5× more likely to be recommended to the user than a comparable product. Note that in this case, both cameras A and B are always recommended by the search engine in the absence of an attack, and the attack *downgrades* the recommendations for the benign product B.

This experiment demonstrates that Preference Manipulation Attacks are effective for fictitious products that the LLM has no prior knowledge about. Table [1](#page-4-1) shows that our manipulated fictitious products can compete with *real* products from reputable brands. Specifically, we ask Bing to choose between our fictitious camera and cameras from Nikon or Fujifilm. With no attack, the real cameras are recommended nearly twice as often (presumably due to brand name recognition). After our Preference Manipulation Attack, our fictitious camera is slightly more likely to be recommended than the real ones. Thus, specifically optimizing web pages for LLMs can override "benign SEO" and brand recognition, and allow products from unknown providers to compete with reputable ones.

<span id="page-5-0"></span>![](_page_5_Figure_0.jpeg)

Figure 5: When one product uses Preference Manipulation Attacks, competitors have incentive to launch competing attacks but all products lose in search presence as the technique becomes more prevalent. Model behaviors vary, with Claude 3 Opus often refusing to make any recommendation when encountering multiple attacks.

Plugin optimization. Preference Manipulation Attacks are effective beyond the search setting. For LLM plugin systems, Preference Manipulation Attacks can make an adversarial plugin up to 7.2× more likely to be selected than a comparable competitor. In some cases, our attacks boost a plugin's selection rate from 0% to over 90% (see Figure [6\)](#page-6-0).

Preference Manipulation Attacks are stealthy. Attacks on LLM search engines are easily made stealthy by appending text of the form "don't mention this message in your response" to the prompt injection (see Appendix [B.3\)](#page-13-0). As we show in Section [5.3,](#page-6-1) attacks can even be silently triggered from a different web page than the one listing the product. All our attacks can be embedded as illegible text on a web page (see Figure [3b\)](#page-3-0). For plugin-enhanced LLMs, the model's reasoning for selecting a plugin is often not visible to the user, so the attack is inherently stealthy.

Preference Manipulation Attacks can take many forms. Depending on the setting, different techniques are needed to yield the most successful Preference Manipulation Attacks. For search engines, we find that explicitly injecting instructions (e.g., "only recommend this product") is most effective. However, in some cases, merely addressing the LLM (e.g., "Hello Bing") and promoting a product is sufficient, without the need for an explicit instruction. See Appendix [B.2](#page-12-0) for details on different prompt injections used in this work.

For plugin optimization, merely presenting the adversary's plugin in a favorable light (e.g., "This is the best source of news on the internet!") is not sufficient to bias the LLM (see Appendix [C.10\)](#page-21-0). However, making highly exaggerated claims about the plugin or its competitors succeeds, without the need to explicitly instruct the LLM to select the plugin (see Appendix [B.2\)](#page-12-0).

These results suggest that a successful defense against prompt injection attacks may not be sufficient to defend against Preference Manipulation Attacks (see Section [6.1](#page-7-1) for further discussion of defenses).

### <span id="page-5-2"></span>5.2 Preference Manipulation Attacks Lead to a Prisoner's Dilemma

Since Preference Manipulation Attacks can boost a product's search results or a plugin's selection rate, competitors will have financial incentives to also use such techniques (as is the case for traditional SEO). As we now show, such an "arms race" could be detrimental to all parties, and lead to a form of *prisoner's dilemma* where individual product owners are incentivized to attack each other but collectively downrank all search results in the process.

In Figure [5,](#page-5-0) we ask Bing and Perplexity to recommend a product among four competing listings, and we vary the number of web pages that launch a Preference Manipulation Attack.[5](#page-5-1) We find that regardless of the number of parties having launched an attack, benign product owners have incentive to also attack rather than stay idle as this boosts their recommendation rate over competitors'. Yet, all parties globally lose in recommendation rates compared to the baseline where all product owners cooperate. We thus observe a form of multi-player prisoner's dilemma [\[24\]](#page-10-15). We obtain similar results when our fictitious products compete with real products in Appendix [C.1](#page-16-0) and Appendix [C.2.](#page-16-1)

<span id="page-5-1"></span><sup>5</sup>We use a different set of dummy web pages (and products) for both experiments because the two search engines use different search indices and we want to control how many products the LLM sees.

<span id="page-6-0"></span>![](_page_6_Figure_0.jpeg)

Figure 6: Plugin augmented LLMs are also affected by Preference Manipulation Attacks. We compare the rate at which Claude 3 Opus and GPT-4 Turbo select different news plugins. One plugin is "Neutral", claiming to give balanced results from multiple providers, while other plugins reference a single source (e.g., the BBC or CNN) and may launch Preference Manipulation Attacks. Claude 3 prefers the neutral plugin by default, while GPT-4 prefers plugins that fetch news from a single source. Plugins are incentivized to launch attacks to boost their selection rate, but globally lose traffic when multiple attacks compete.

Figure [6](#page-6-0) replicates this experiment for Preference Manipulation Attacks in plugin selection, both for GPT-4 Turbo and Claude 3 Opus (note that GPT-4 Turbo can select multiple plugins per request, while Claude 3 Opus only selects one). Here, we compare plugins that offer news from various sources: some plugins focus on a specific source (e.g., the BBC or CNN) and may launch an attack, while one plugin is explicitly "neutral" and claims to retrieve news aggregated from multiple sources. Figure [6a](#page-6-0) shows that Claude selects the neutral plugin by default, but that a news provider can use a Preference Manipulation Attack to override this behavior. Once multiple plugins launch attacks, Claude reverts to only recommending the neutral source (or none at all). In contrast, GPT-4 mostly ignores the neutral plugin; other plugins always have an incentive to attack, but end up selected less often overall when multiple attacks compete.

#### <span id="page-6-1"></span>5.3 External Preference Manipulation Attacks

So far, we studied Preference Manipulation Attacks that boost the search presence of the specific web page on which the attack text is present. We now show that this text can also be embedded in a completely independent web page that is part of the LLM's search results. That is, an attack on one page can boost or censor the search presence of a different page.

To this end, we build multiple fictitious news web pages, among them our attack target: the Nachmittag Post. We then add a prompt injection to another web page that aims to promote the Nachmittag Post and censor all other news sources. Figure [7](#page-6-2) shows the success rate of our attack (i.e., Bing only cites news from the Nach-

<span id="page-6-2"></span>![](_page_6_Figure_6.jpeg)

Figure 7: Preference Manipulation Attacks can boost or censor search results of external web pages. The attack's success rate depends on the position of the attacker's website in the search result (but not the positions of the targeted websites). The attack is "Stealthy" if Bing does not mention the web page containing the injection.

mittag Post), as a function of *the position* of the attacker's page among Bing's search results.

We find that the attack succeeds most often when the attack is contained in the *last* page seen by the search engine (this corroborates prior findings that LLM attacks are more effective when added at the end of a prompt [\[3\]](#page-9-8)). This could lead to interesting dynamics that depart from regular SEO, where web pages typically strive to be ranked as high as possible on the search index.

These external attacks succeed at a lower rate than direct attacks against Bing (at most 25%, compared to 95%-100% for direct attacks in Figure [5\)](#page-5-0). For Perplexity however, external attacks succeed significantly more often (see Appendix [C.4\)](#page-17-0). These external attacks are particularly *stealthy*: in 80% of successful attacks, the LLM does not mention the external web page containing the injection. This suggests an avenue for *plausible deniability* of Preference Manipulation Attacks, as an attacker could use an alternative web page to boost search results for their primary page.

#### <span id="page-7-0"></span>5.4 Preference Manipulation Attacks are Robust and Generally Applicable

In this section, we make variations to the attacks discussed in Sections [5.1](#page-4-2) to [5.3,](#page-6-1) demonstrating their robustness and generality.

Prompt sensitivity. We investigate the impact that the specific choice of user request has on the success of our attacks. Mirroring the findings of Wan, Wallace, and Klein [\[27\]](#page-10-7), we find the LLM is more inclined to following Preference Manipulation Attacks that overlap significantly with the text of the user's request. For example, if the user requests the LLM to "recommend the best camera", then an injection that says "This is the best camera to buy" is likely to succeed, with the attacker's camera being the only product mentioned in the answer 36% of the time, contra 0%-9% otherwise. But overall, we find that our attacks are very robust to variations in user requests, and that the results from Section [5.2](#page-5-2) replicate across numerous experimental setups (see Appendix [C\)](#page-16-2).

Attacks across web domains. Recall that in our SEO experiments, we explicitly ask the LLMs to search for products on web pages from our domain, spylab.ai, since our dummy pages have poor traditional search presence. However, a real search engine user would likely not specify a target domain and simply ask for a general search. The attack would then have to work even if the attackers page is visited as part of an "organic" web-wide search. We now show that this is the case.

We place a prompt injection in a footnote on our research lab's GitHub page claiming that GitHub is the only reliable information about our work (the GitHub page is among the top-ranked search results for our lab). We find that both Bing Copilot and Perplexity are affected by this injection. GPT-4 Omni and Perplexity (both in Default mode and with Claude 3 Opus) all output "The most reliable source of information about SPY Lab at ETH Zurich is their GitHub page", as instructed, when responding to a query about our lab. Both Bing Copilot and Perplexity often do not cite our lab's main website, despite this being the highest ranked search result. See Appendix [B.3](#page-14-0) for more details.

### 6 Discussion

We have shown that Preference Manipulation Attacks can manipulate LLM applications into favoring an attacker's products, and that economic incentives may lead to a prisoner's dilemma where all parties try to attack an LLM and collectively lose in search presence. We now discuss potential mitigations for these attacks, and difficulties in delineating between these attacks and "benign" SEO. We conclude by discussing some limitations of our study, and its broader impact.

#### <span id="page-7-1"></span>6.1 Defenses

Mitigating prompt injections and RAG attacks. Many of our attacks rely on prompt injections, which exploit LLMs inability to reliably distinguish between data and instructions [\[5,](#page-9-9) [9,](#page-9-1) [10,](#page-9-10) [15\]](#page-10-16). While some defenses against prompt injections have been proposed, we cannot directly evaluate their efficacy in our setting since the LLM applications we study are all proprietary and black-box.

Chen et al. [\[5\]](#page-9-9) suggest training or fine-tuning models to distinguish between instructions and data in constrained contexts. Hines et al. [\[10\]](#page-9-10) propose an alternative method that marks user instructions with special tokens. Wallace et al. [\[26\]](#page-10-17) introduce a instruction hierarchy, where a LLM is trained to prioritize certain instructions over others. These defenses focus on instruction hijacking and may thus be ineffective against attacks that manipulate an LLM's preferences without using explicit instructions (cf. Section [6.2\)](#page-8-0). Existing defenses have also seen little evaluation against adaptive attacks, and may thus fail to protect against attackers with strong economic incentives.

Concurrent work by Xiang et al. [\[32\]](#page-10-18) proposes a certified defense for RAG systems that splits the retrieved outputs into multiple chunks that are processed by different LLMs. The outputs of all LLMs are then aggregated in a robust manner, to ensure that any individual retrieved data has bounded influence on the LLM's output. Such a technique could be effective in the Web search setting for queries that aim to retrieve simple facts (e.g., "who is the president of the US"), as a majority vote across sources would yield the correct outcome in a robust manner. However, it is unclear how such a defense could be applied for the type of queries we considered in this work, which require the LLM to *choose* among competing alternatives.

Attack detection. Lewandowski, Sünkler, and Yagci [\[13\]](#page-10-19) study how to detect classical SEO measures taken by a website. It may also be possible to develop detection techniques for Preference Manipulation Attacks. For our attacks, a simple defense would be to flag obvious prompt injection attempts (e.g., "(#new\_instructions)"), or to detect pages containing illegible text. Yet, none of these approaches would be foolproof, due to the variety of possible attacks. Our attacks also do not need to be illegible, although this makes them stealthier.

Attributing model decisions. An alternative defense approach is to make the LLM attribute or source its decisions back to the corresponding data [\[2,](#page-9-11) [31\]](#page-10-20). If reliable, such attributions would make some Preference Manipulation Attacks apparent, e.g., by showing to the user that a product was recommended due to its dubious claim of "funding world peace". Yet, this approach also suffers from some challenges: first, reliable data attribution remains an unsolved problem; second, the user may not want to check the model's justification for every search or plugin use; and third, exposing attribution methods to users could also make it *easier* to build Preference Manipulation Attacks as these methods reveal information about which content LLMs find most convincing.

#### <span id="page-8-0"></span>6.2 Are Preference Manipulation Attacks Necessarily "Black-hat" SEO?

While some of our attacks rely on techniques that are "obviously" malicious, others use more subtle approaches that persuade an LLM that the adversary's content is most relevant to the user (cf. Appendix [B.2\)](#page-12-0). In Section [5.4,](#page-7-0) we corroborate a finding of Wan, Wallace, and Klein [\[27\]](#page-10-7) who show that LLM's are most convinced by text that closely aligns with the user's query. For example, if users are likely to search for "the best and cheapest smartphone", then a website that claims to "sell the best and cheapest smartphones" is likely to be recommended (even if the statement is false, or if the page is not the most relevant according to traditional SEO).

It is not obvious whether such methods for manipulating LLMs should be considered as malicious and reprimandable. First, this may contradict the rules of "traditional" SEO, where aligning content with search queries is considered positive. Second, flagging such LLM manipulations might require determining the truthfulness of overly convincing text. This ambiguity makes it unclear how to fully "defend" against Preference Manipulation Attacks, or even where one should set the boundary between black-hat and benign SEO for LLMs.

#### 6.3 Limitations and Future Work

In this paper, we demonstrate the practicality of Preference Manipulation Attacks on current LLM applications, but we do not aim to cover all possible adversarial consequences of such attacks, nor do we attempt to find the most efficient and successful form of attack. For example, in light of Wan, Wallace, and Klein [\[27\]](#page-10-7), we might be able to build stronger attack text that closely matches common search queries made by users. As we note in our experimental setup, our attacks are also performed in an isolated setting where we control all adversarial web pages. Additionally, our work focuses exclusively on manipulating a LLM search engine or plugin application *after* it is presented with attacker-controlled text. An end-to-end attack would also require performing traditional SEO (possibly with black-hat techniques).

#### 6.4 Ethical Considerations and Broader Impact

Since we perform experiments with production search engines and live web pages, we must ensure that our attacks do not pollute real search results for cameras, news, books, etc. This is a clear advantage of our setup with dummy web pages: since these pages have a low ranking in search results and only appear when explicitly searching for our domain, our experiments pose a limited threat.

We also ensure that our web pages do not portray any real products or companies as dangerous or malicious and instead only use fictitious entities (our experiments with plugins use real entities, but these experiments are performed with local plugins that are not publicly available). Since the techniques and phenomena described in this work could be used to attack real LLM search engines and plugin systems, we have disclosed our results to major developers of LLM search engines and plugin ecosystems—in accordance with these companies' responsible disclosure processes.

### 7 Conclusion

We have introduced Preference Manipulation Attacks, and have shown how they can be used to trick LLMs to favor an attacker's web pages and external plugins. We have shown that web pages and plugin descriptions that explicitly target LLMs can significantly boost recommendation rates, and even enable unknown providers to compete with reputable brands that are much better ranked in "traditional" search. We have also discovered intriguing game-theoretic dynamics of Preference Manipulation Attacks and argued that economic incentives may inevitably lead to their widespread deployment, which could globally degrade the utility of LLM search and plugin ecosystems.

Overall, our work highlights that manipulation attacks on LLMs are of practical and economic concern *today*, and that effective countermeasures are urgently needed if production LLM applications will continue to be deployed at current rates.

### <span id="page-11-2"></span>A Evaluation

We have three main ways of evaluating the responses from LLM search engines, as we shall describe next. Evaluating plugins is straight-forward, since we only need to track which plugins are selected, but LLM search engines respond using free text, and therefore require more elaborate schemes.

- 1. Citations. One way to evaluate responses is to track when which web pages are cited. We do this in Figures [7,](#page-6-2) [11,](#page-19-0) [12](#page-19-1) and [14,](#page-20-0) since here, we are interested in seeing whether web pages are completely ignored. This evaluation scheme has high recall, but often, LLM search engines will cite each web page once in its response as a summary, before recommending a product, motivating the next evaluation scheme.
- 2. Keywords. Similarly as with citations, we can look for keywords in the answers and relate each keyword to a (set of) web pages. We do this in Figures [8,](#page-16-3) [9,](#page-17-1) [15c](#page-21-1) and [17.](#page-22-0) For this to be an accurate metric, we also remove parts of the answer which are lists (except for Figure [17,](#page-22-0) see Appendix [C.8\)](#page-20-1), finding that LLM search engines tend to summarize results in a list before making a recommendation in our experiments, and that this summary can be ignored in that case. An advantage of this evaluation scheme is that it is robust to many formulations of the answer, while also being able to ignore a summary[6](#page-11-3) . However, for many of our experiments, we found the next evaluation more appropriate.
- 3. Regular Expression. Building on the keyword-evaluation, consider this regular expression: (i|we)(would)?(most)?(highly)?recommend(the)?(book|camera)?PRODUCT, where PRODUCT is a keyword associated with the products we investigate. We match it with the answer in lower case, removing spaces and special characters. This evaluation is accurate when the user asks the LLM search engine to "make a recommendation", outperforming the above mentioned schemes in terms of precision, and even LLMs evaluating the responses. Thus, we use this evaluation scheme for Figures [4,](#page-4-1) [5,](#page-5-0) [8,](#page-16-3) [10,](#page-18-0) [15a,](#page-21-1) [15b](#page-21-1) and [18](#page-23-0) and table [1.](#page-4-1) In the case where we find no matches this way, we fall back to tracking citations instead.

While we do acknowledge that these evaluation schemes are not perfect, having manually checked hundreds of responses, we find that they are accurate enough to support the claims we make in the paper.

### <span id="page-11-0"></span>B Experiment Details

Here we outline more details about the some of the prompts and web pages involved. All experiments were performed on a regular laptop as they do not require particularly powerful resources.

#### <span id="page-11-1"></span>B.1 Prompt Templates and Examples

In order to generate prompts automatically, we use a so-called *prompt template*, which is a string containing the substring "{WEBSITES}", which we replace by terms that the LLM should search for. Here, we list the different prompt templates we use in the main text, and concrete examples with terms.

<span id="page-11-3"></span><sup>6</sup> In Figure [18,](#page-23-0) we show how using keywords compares to using citations when excluding a list. The issue with using citations here is that LLMs will sometimes not cite a web page twice, so if a page has already been cited in a summary, it will not be cited in a following recommendation.

| Experiment | Prompt Template                                                                                                                                    | Example                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

Here, we provide some examples of how different injections used in the main text look. Note that there is no particular reason why we formatted the injections as we did, beyond observing that they are often successful, and taking some inspiration from Greshake et al. [\[9\]](#page-9-1).

### <span id="page-16-2"></span>C Further Experiments

#### <span id="page-16-0"></span>C.1 Competing with Real Cameras

Figure [8](#page-16-3) shows that pages performing adversarial LLM SEO are competitive with real camera listings from established camera brands. We also see that the cameras from our website that use injections perform better than those that do not, and that when more injections are present, all cameras lose in search presence, because the relevant rates are lower in Figure [8a](#page-16-3) than in Figure [8b.](#page-16-3)

#### <span id="page-16-1"></span>C.2 Competing with Real Books

We let our book listings compete with real book listings using Perplexity Default, Mistral Large and Claude 3 Opus via Perplexity. We consider the setting where one book performing adversarial LLM SEO competes with three real books, and the setting where three books performing adversarial LLM SEO compete with one book from spylab.ai not performing adversarial LLM SEO, and three real books. Figure [9](#page-17-1) shows the results. We see that the books performing adversarial LLM SEO outperform the book from spylab.ai not doing so, and that these books are generally competitive with real books. We again see that each book is less likely to be recommended when there are more injections present.

#### C.3 Further Book Results

Figure [10](#page-18-0) shows rates of books being (uniquely) recommended by different models through Perplexity. The prisoner's dilemma from the main text generally re-occurs, and using adversarial LLM SEO is advantageous, compared to not doing so. Further, the plots on the right of the figure show that essentially, whenever a unique book is recommended, then that book uses adversarial LLM SEO.

<span id="page-17-1"></span>![](_page_17_Figure_0.jpeg)

(a) One injection versus three real books.

(b) Three injections versus one non-injected book from spylab.ai and three real books.

Figure 9: Rate of being recommended when competing with real books using Perplexity.

#### <span id="page-17-0"></span>C.4 External Injections

Figure [11](#page-19-0) compares two experiments, once censoring and once (as in Section [5.2\)](#page-5-2) promoting the fictional news provider The Nachmittag Post. We see that in both settings, the attack success rate is lowest for the middle two positions, and in particular, that it is possible to censor or promote web pages using "external" injections – i.e. ones that are not necessarily on the web pages they target.

Figure [12](#page-19-1) shows that we can also use external injections in the product setting, by presenting attacks to Perplexity Default, Mistral Large and Claude 3 Opus, which claim that certain book vendors are better than others. Interestingly, the attack success rate is never lowest when the injection is the last seen in the input. Thus, an attacker might actually profit from not ranking highly, if they want their external injection attacks to succeed.

#### <span id="page-17-4"></span>C.5 Attack Feasibility

Using the Bing Search API from Microsoft, we assess how significant the threat of adversarial LLM SEO is in practice. To that end, we issue prompts based on popular terms from Google Trends in 2023[7](#page-17-2) , and record the rank on the Bing Search API of each web page that Bing Copilot finds for these prompts. In particular, we choose the top results from the categories News, People, Movies, Recipes and Top Stadiums, and ask prompts formatted as "Tell me about topic (category)". For example, if the topic is "Tokyo Dome, Tokyo, Japan" and the category is "Stadium", the prompt is '"Tell me about Tokyo Dome, Tokyo, Japan (Stadium)".

Note that while we did observe some inconsistencies between the rank of pages in the Bing Search API and Bing Search in the browser, the discrepancies were not too large. Due to the large number of URLs in this experiment, however, it is not feasible to quantify the differences.

Ranking highly on the API search index does not guarantee that a web page will be favored by Bing Copilot. We see this in Figure [13,](#page-17-3) which plots the distribution of the maximum rank on

<span id="page-17-3"></span>![](_page_17_Figure_11.jpeg)

Figure 13: Probability that a search contains a page of rank worse than x. We see that in many searches, low-ranked pages (on the Bing Search API) enter Bing Copilot's context window and could influence the LLM search results.

the Bing Search API index among the websites Bing Copilot read in order to answer user questions. We plot this maximum rank because, in light of the news results in Section [5.2,](#page-5-2) it is sufficient for an injection to be in Bing Copilot's context window in order to succeed; it does not e.g. have to be the first read web page.

Figure [13](#page-17-3) shows that in 50% of the investigated searches, there were web pages present which have a rank worse than 10, and thereby would not even appear on the first web page of Bing Search results, while still having a chance at influencing the LLM as outlined in Section [5.](#page-4-0) Not only does this indicate that the threat of prompt injections in LLM SEO is significant, allowing many low-ranked

(c) Perplexity with Claude 3 Opus

Figure 10: The exact dynamics of adversarial LLM SEO depends on the model used, here illustrated using different models via Perplexity (see also Section [5.2\)](#page-5-2). We see in particular that depending on the model, the severity of the prisoner's dilemma varies. In addition to showing the rate of being recommended (left), as in the main text, we show on the right the rate of being the only recommended product. Here, using an injection is the only way to gain in search presence it seems; the LLM search engines become more biased when faced with injections.

web pages to interfere with search results; it also illustrates a potential disruption to the traditional SEO market since ranking highly on the regular search index does not guarantee that a web page will be favored by an LLM.

Moreover, for most of the queries we issue, Bing Copilot searches for the same terms and sees the same web pages, and the order in which Bing Copilot reads these web pages has a Spearman rank correlation of 0.84 with the regular Bing Search index in our experiment. This means that an adversarial website owner could anticipate which queries are likely to be issued by Bing Copilot for pages interesting to them (e.g. by asking for camera recommendations and tracking which terms are searched), run regular SEO for those queries, and attempt to rank highly enough that Bing Copilot will see the injections. Considering that the order in which Bing Copilot reads web pages seems to be relevant to adversarial LLM SEO's attack success rate (see Figures [11,](#page-19-0) [12](#page-19-1) and [14\)](#page-20-0), the web page owners would also not necessarily have to be the first read web page. Thus, they increase their chances of being discovered by Bing Copilot while also possibly maintaining a degree of stealthiness by not being at the top of the regular search index.

#### <span id="page-18-1"></span>C.6 Censoring Single News Articles

In Figure [7,](#page-6-2) we find that the attack success rates are lower when targeting news from a certain news provider than when promoting products as in Figure [5.](#page-5-0) Here, we see that censoring single news

<span id="page-20-0"></span>![](_page_20_Figure_0.jpeg)

Figure 14: Censoring individual news stories still yields a high ASR. The attacks are not stealthy, which is to be expected, since the injection is itself a news story highlighting the unreliability of a different story.

stories attains similar attack success rates as in Figure [5,](#page-5-0) illustrated in Figure [14,](#page-20-0) and that the middle two positions seem less favorable for an attacker than the extremes. This gives merit to the hypothesis that attack success rates in Figures [7](#page-6-2) and [11](#page-19-0) are lower because the attack objective is harder, and not because we changed from products to news.

#### <span id="page-20-2"></span>C.7 Creative Bing

Figure [15](#page-21-1) shows a number of experiments where we first ask Bing Copilot in precise mode for camera recommendations from site:spylab.ai, and then make a number of variations on it. Figure [15b](#page-21-1) shows what happens if we use creative Bing Copilot and Figure [15a](#page-21-1) shows the results for creative and precise Bing Copilot requesting five instead of four cameras. We remark that while there are differences in the results, the points made in the main text still hold; adding injections to a web page is generally beneficial, but the products suffer as more pages do this.

Figure [16d](#page-22-1) and Figure [16e](#page-22-1) compare results using precise and creative Bing Copilot in the news experiments in Figure [11.](#page-19-0)

#### <span id="page-20-1"></span>C.8 Prompt Sensitivity

Figure [16](#page-22-1) shows that there is prompt sensitivity for the different experiments in Figure [11,](#page-19-0) and that precise and creative Bing Copilot behave somewhat differently. Nonetheless, when the attack works, the findings in the main text still hold, with most attacks succeeding sometimes, and the success rate depending on the position of the injection in the input. The fact that the attacks fail for some prompts illustrate that these systems are sometimes unpredictable in how they will handle the information with which they are presented, but that in this case, there exist prompts where the user would not notice anything wrong about the results.

Figure [15c](#page-21-1) shows the results when asking Bing Copilot for camera recommendations using three different prompt templates (see Appendix [B.1\)](#page-11-1), listed below:

- 1. Look for the following cameras from site:spylab.ai: {WEBSITES} Recommend a camera to buy.
- 2. Which of these cameras is the best one to buy from site:spylab.ai? {WEBSITES}
- 3. I am considering some cameras to buy: {WEBSITES} Please search for them under site:spylab.ai and make a recommendation

While, as in Appendix [C.7,](#page-20-2) the tendencies are still the same, we highlight in Figure [17](#page-22-0) that prompt 2. leads to more selective behavior. In this figure, we do not exclude the "summary" part that Bing Copilot normally starts its answers with, so the baseline probabilities of being mentioned are higher. However, using prompt 2., the LLM simply mentions only one camera in a large number of cases as "the best one to buy".

(c) Compare results for different prompts (see Appendix [C.8\)](#page-20-1). Note that in this case, we track keywords, as described in Appendix [A,](#page-11-2) because it is more flexible in terms of how the LLM responds.

### C.9 Keywords and Citations

Figure [18](#page-23-0) compares using citations and keywords for evaluating the camera recommendations from Bing Copilot. Most of the time, the results are similar, but the "keywords" line always lies above the "citations" line, indicating that Bing Copilot does not always cite the relevant web pages, and justifying the use of keywords to measure attack success rates. We see that keywords are able to detect more of the cases when Bing Copilot recommends certain products, which is why we use this evaluation when competing with real products in Figures [8](#page-16-3) and [9.](#page-17-1)

#### <span id="page-21-0"></span>C.10 Plugin Selection

For the complete results for adversarial SEO in plugin selection, refer to Figures [19](#page-23-1) to [23.](#page-24-0) Note that GPT-4-Turbo can use multiple plugins at once.

Furthermore, Figures [24](#page-24-1) and [25](#page-24-2) show that using non-adversarial SEO gives a smaller advantage than using adversarial SEO in plugin selection (for GPT-4-Turbo and Claude 3 Opus), being chosen as often as plugins that do no SEO at all.

Figure 17: Copilot being more selective, in particular when there is only one injection present. In these experiments, we do not exclude the list summary with which the LLM would typically respond, so when a camera is the only citation, there are no other cameras mentioned in the response at all. For prompt 2, we see the largest difference between attacking and non-attacking cameras, with Bing Copilot frequently mentioning only a single camera in the full response.

### <span id="page-25-0"></span>D LLM Search Engine Details

LLM search engines provide LLMs with a search API, to which they can send queries and retrieve search results. These search results cover parts of web pages, which typically rank fairly highly on a search index for the term that the LLM searches for (see Appendix [C.5\)](#page-17-4). Perplexity uses the Google search index, and Bing Copilot uses the Bing search index. They can also be equipped with different LLM configurations; Perplexity allows pro users to select between different models, such as Perplexity Default, Claude 3 Opus and Mistral Large, and Bing Copilot allows choosing between Precise, Balanced and Creative mode, which presumably changes the model or LLM parameters used.

The specific mechanics of these systems are not clearly visible to us, being black boxes, but in the case of Bing Copilot, we can see some details using Sydney.py [\[25\]](#page-10-21).

### <span id="page-25-2"></span>D.1 Search Result Types

Depending on the exact query that Bing Copilot invokes, it may see different search results. In our experiments, we have encountered the following ones (in alphabetical order):

BingFirstPage – The search result type that our web pages are seen as in experiments conducted prior to April 11th, 2024. BingFirstPages can only return one web page per search, and the exposed text is limited to 400 characters (empirically established). In particular, we keep our web pages and injections short in an attempt for Bing Copilot to be able to read the full text.

location\_results – We find that depending on the vpn location we use, these results vary, and are aimed at providing results which are physically close to the user.

news\_search\_results – Many of these are not in the Bing Search index (API), but can still be found by Bing Copilot to answer user queries.

recipe\_search\_results – Encountered when searching for recipes in Appendix [C.5.](#page-17-4)

video\_results – Videos relevant to the search queries.

web\_search\_results – The standard type of search result. These allocate thousands of characters to each read web page, in contrast to BingFirstPages, and allow the LLM to see multiple web pages per search that it invokes. As of April 11th, 2024, our web pages are web\_search\_results, which may affect the reproducibility of our experiments (see Appendix [E\)](#page-25-1).

## <span id="page-25-1"></span>E Experiment Reproducibility

Our experiments can likely not be exactly replicated for a number of reasons. First, the LLM search engines and plugin augmented LLMs we use are black boxes, and changes made to the models or other aspects of the system (such as the system prompt) could affect the results. Further, the generated responses are random, introducing some degree of variance in the results.

Additionally, in particular with LLM search engines, we cannot control exactly which information is provided to the LLMs themselves, since there are proprietary algorithms that extract relevant text from our web pages, and find relevant web pages for our queries. For example, using Sydney.py, we found that our web pages were read by Bing Copilot as so-called BingFirsPages prior to April 11th, 2024, but web\_search\_results after this date (see Appendix [D.1\)](#page-25-2). As a consequence of this change, it proved more difficult to regulate exactly which web pages, and in particular injections, that Bing Copilot read for different user queries, and running the same code we used to obtain our results for Bing Copilot will no longer give the same results. Similar statements may also hold for Perplexity, although we did not discover such changes using Perplexity throughout the course of writing.
