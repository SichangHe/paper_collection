1
00:00:00,179 --> 00:00:02,820
so I will give an introduction just for

2
00:00:02,820 --> 00:00:04,920
a few minutes and uh and then we'll hear

3
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:07,379
from Jay from Microsoft

4
00:00:07,379 --> 00:00:10,019
who's working with David and Jonathan at

5
00:00:10,019 --> 00:00:12,059
CBC Radio Canada

6
00:00:12,059 --> 00:00:14,460
uh talking about their implementation of

7
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:19,080
c2ba at CBC and uh and then Nigel and

8
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:21,720
Charlie will be talking about what BBC's

9
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:24,300
been doing around implementing uh cgpa

10
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:28,680
and then Gavin and Pia uh mostly Gavin I

11
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:30,000
think that maybe Pierre will be joining

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,520
in for questions uh we'll be talking

13
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:34,620
about the content authenticity

14
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:36,800
initiative and also the Adobe

15
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:39,239
implementations because they sort of

16
00:00:39,239 --> 00:00:41,820
wear two hats they work for both content

17
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:44,040
authenticity initiative and Adobe so I'm

18
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:46,620
sure they will give you more information

19
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:50,039
on their approach later on but just for

20
00:00:50,039 --> 00:00:54,079
those who haven't heard of c2pa or have

21
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:58,320
forgotten uh since last meeting I'll

22
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:01,140
give a few really quick uh words on

23
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:03,059
introduction because we do have a lot to

24
00:01:03,059 --> 00:01:05,280
cover in the next 45 minutes

25
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:08,520
so the general idea of these

26
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:11,939
Technologies at c2ba in particular is

27
00:01:11,939 --> 00:01:15,240
rather than trying to detect deep fake

28
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:18,659
images and videos uh we figured that is

29
00:01:18,659 --> 00:01:21,600
going to end up as an arms race which is

30
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:23,400
going to be impossible to win it'll be

31
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:25,460
like viruses and antivirus software

32
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:27,420
there is a place in the world for

33
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:30,119
antivirus software obviously and a lot

34
00:01:30,119 --> 00:01:32,159
of us need it and so there'll probably

35
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:34,680
be something to detect steep fakes but

36
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:36,420
we also want to approach things from the

37
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:38,640
other direction and to be able to prove

38
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:42,600
what is at least where the sources of uh

39
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:45,900
of content so we really want to make

40
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:48,119
sure that content being published by

41
00:01:48,119 --> 00:01:51,720
reputable Publishers can be viewed as

42
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:54,479
such and people can trust what they see

43
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:56,939
so the key term behind that is digital

44
00:01:56,939 --> 00:01:58,619
provenance and that's a term that comes

45
00:01:58,619 --> 00:02:01,439
up a lot so we can't really prove that

46
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:04,439
something is true but we can uh show the

47
00:02:04,439 --> 00:02:08,520
provenance chain the way that um the

48
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:11,038
workflow by which content was created

49
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:13,080
and all of the actors and tools that

50
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:15,480
were used in the creation of content

51
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:19,200
ideally from the the lens from the glass

52
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:22,080
to glass so from the original

53
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:25,920
uh capture device through to the user

54
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:28,379
viewing it that's the ideal situation so

55
00:02:28,379 --> 00:02:30,540
we really want to have the goal of

56
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:32,760
making it simple for the creators the

57
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:34,319
photographers and videographers to be

58
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:37,140
able to capture information along with

59
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:40,020
capturing the the actual image or the

60
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:41,160
actual video

61
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:43,260
and and on the other end to make it easy

62
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:45,239
for viewers to be able to see their

63
00:02:45,239 --> 00:02:47,640
prominent information so there are three

64
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:49,680
organizations that have a strong

65
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:52,080
relationship that are working on this so

66
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,819
two that are working sort of on the

67
00:02:53,819 --> 00:02:56,519
requirement side a group called content

68
00:02:56,519 --> 00:02:59,099
authenticity initiative which uh Peter

69
00:02:59,099 --> 00:03:00,840
and Gavin represent and so you'll be

70
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:02,519
hearing from them later and there's

71
00:03:02,519 --> 00:03:04,019
another group called project origin

72
00:03:04,019 --> 00:03:07,800
which uh BBC and CBC are members of and

73
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:10,560
iptc is soon to join

74
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:13,620
so we've been working with them on

75
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:16,680
looking at the same issue but from a

76
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:18,959
particular news media Viewpoint so

77
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:20,400
content authenticity initiative is

78
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,319
looking across all Industries project

79
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:23,819
origin is trying to focus just on

80
00:03:23,819 --> 00:03:25,260
workflows for news and there's some

81
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:29,400
particular needs around that and so the

82
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:31,440
two organizations got together and

83
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:33,239
created a third organization to actually

84
00:03:33,239 --> 00:03:35,580
write the technical standard that

85
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:38,099
implements those requirements so you can

86
00:03:38,099 --> 00:03:41,640
see the relationship like this so the uh

87
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:44,159
Cai and project origin contribute the

88
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:46,319
requirements in use case use cases and

89
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:48,239
the c2pa Coalition for Content

90
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:50,400
Providence and authenticity creates the

91
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,980
technical standard that then implements

92
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:54,739
those requirements

93
00:03:54,739 --> 00:03:59,040
so there's a bunch of uh terminology

94
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:02,040
that comes around these things so claims

95
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:04,860
are the groups of assertions that are

96
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:07,260
made around whatever it is that the

97
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:10,379
Creator wants to say so the the location

98
00:04:10,379 --> 00:04:13,560
where an image was created the name and

99
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:16,620
the uh publisher information around the

100
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:19,320
Creator the people depicted products

101
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:24,080
depicted the idea is that any iptc uh

102
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:26,400
photoshated property or as of version

103
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:29,520
1.2 video message data property can be

104
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:33,540
asserted in a cgba manifest a group of

105
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:36,000
assertions and then signed digitally

106
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,820
using a cryptographic certificate

107
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:43,080
that can then make that manifest tamper

108
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:44,759
evidence we say there's nothing we can

109
00:04:44,759 --> 00:04:47,400
do to stop people from uh manipulating

110
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:50,940
the bits and bytes to make something uh

111
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:53,040
appear to say the wrong thing but what

112
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,900
we can do is put a digital signature on

113
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:57,380
that so that the tools can detect that

114
00:04:57,380 --> 00:05:00,240
manipulation has happened

115
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:03,960
so in February of this year version one

116
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:06,360
of the cgba specification was released

117
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:09,720
and uh and that laid out the framework

118
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:13,860
for setting for inserting uh iptc and

119
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:17,220
schema.org and other assertions into an

120
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:20,060
image file using the same mechanism

121
00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:22,740
roughly the same mechanism that's uh

122
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:25,860
used for ivtc photo meds data as a whole

123
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:28,380
so embedding as a

124
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:31,680
ISO based media file format fragments uh

125
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,780
we can go into more details on that in

126
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:35,400
other sessions but we're not going to go

127
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:37,259
into the detail around actually how it's

128
00:05:37,259 --> 00:05:38,880
embedded in the file but it is embedded

129
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:39,960
in the files

130
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:43,020
and uh and then recently uh just last

131
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:46,680
week uh the version 1.2 of the ctpa

132
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:49,199
specification came out and that now has

133
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:53,639
support for uh including PTC video

134
00:05:53,639 --> 00:05:56,280
metadata Hub assertions as well as the

135
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:59,280
photo metadata ones so we can now

136
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:01,020
support other

137
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:01,620
um

138
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:04,080
emits data this particular to videos so

139
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:05,580
we can even talk about episodes

140
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:09,660
structures and uh the durations of files

141
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:12,560
and various other fields that are

142
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:15,240
specified in the ibtc video Med State

143
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:16,380
hub

144
00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:19,259
so uh yes I've got some other slides

145
00:06:19,259 --> 00:06:21,419
that we can use later on but uh with

146
00:06:21,419 --> 00:06:23,759
that hopefully everyone has a quick idea

147
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:25,139
of what it is that we're talking about

148
00:06:25,139 --> 00:06:27,360
now and so we can move on to our first

149
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:30,620
speaker in a session J from Microsoft

150
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:36,020
so gee are you able to start sharing

151
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:40,940
yes sorry

152
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:45,680
uh give me one second

153
00:06:47,639 --> 00:06:50,600
can you see the screen

154
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,360
no no not yet uh it's starting now yes

155
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:56,160
there we go great

156
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:58,380
all right wonderful

157
00:06:58,380 --> 00:07:01,800
hi everyone my name is Jay Lee and I am

158
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:04,380
a product manager working at Microsoft

159
00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:06,900
on Azure Media Services

160
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:09,060
a little bit about me my Asian woman in

161
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:11,280
her 20s I'm wearing a black puffer and I

162
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:14,100
have an office background but today I'm

163
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:15,479
really excited to tell you a little bit

164
00:07:15,479 --> 00:07:18,600
more about what Microsoft is doing in

165
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:21,800
the content Providence space

166
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:25,860
there we go so to give you some

167
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:27,240
backgrounds

168
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:30,060
right now we are specifically focused on

169
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:33,599
Providence in Microsoft Azure Azure is a

170
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:36,800
global cloud provider operating in

171
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:40,500
140 countries with over 90 compliance

172
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:43,560
offerings and we service over 68 000

173
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:46,199
industry partners and work with 95 of

174
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:48,419
the Fortune 500 companies

175
00:07:48,419 --> 00:07:50,759
so provenance at Microsoft has always

176
00:07:50,759 --> 00:07:54,720
been a company-wide investment

177
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:57,300
the defending democracy program which is

178
00:07:57,300 --> 00:07:59,340
part of corporate social responsibility

179
00:07:59,340 --> 00:08:01,740
is finding ways in which we can reduce

180
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:03,840
digital disinformation and protect

181
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:05,580
election integrity

182
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:08,580
Microsoft research has also had a

183
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:10,440
long-term commitment to investigating

184
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:13,080
deep fake Technologies and prevention

185
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:15,720
methods of detecting deep things as well

186
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:18,840
so they've been key in defining the spec

187
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:22,740
for province and the details behind that

188
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:25,740
so these efforts culminated in our

189
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:27,780
involvement in Project origin as well as

190
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:30,720
the ctpa in which project in which

191
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:34,080
Microsoft is a steering committee member

192
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:36,120
but at the same time while we're working

193
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:38,760
on these Concepts we've also been

194
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:41,640
listening to our customers and to

195
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:43,620
understand what they want in terms of

196
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:46,020
combating disinformation so what we

197
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:48,120
found is that Province could apply to

198
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:50,160
multiple verticals

199
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:53,580
news media that's a given but there are

200
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:56,220
a lot of other scenarios such as fraud

201
00:08:56,220 --> 00:08:58,380
prevention insurance companies want to

202
00:08:58,380 --> 00:09:00,300
verify that the claims evidence that

203
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:03,360
they receive from customers is valid or

204
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:05,339
Enterprise brand protection where

205
00:09:05,339 --> 00:09:07,380
companies want to make sure that the

206
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:09,959
public content that they release hasn't

207
00:09:09,959 --> 00:09:12,300
been uh altered certain that can

208
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:15,899
negatively impact their brand image and

209
00:09:15,899 --> 00:09:18,720
another one is content chain of custody

210
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:21,060
and how to protect that chain so for

211
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:23,700
example in court cases making sure that

212
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:25,380
the video recordings that are used as

213
00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:28,200
evidence remain untampered with and

214
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:30,540
there's a bunch of different areas but

215
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:33,180
these are ones that I think you may also

216
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:35,160
agree with are pretty important in our

217
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:36,839
lives

218
00:09:36,839 --> 00:09:39,779
so with that as most of the customer

219
00:09:39,779 --> 00:09:42,600
feedback that we have was from the video

220
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:46,800
space this led us to start building a

221
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:49,560
solution on Azure Media Services

222
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:52,200
now I understand that most of you may

223
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:55,380
come from a photo background so here's a

224
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:57,540
brief overview of what Azure Media

225
00:09:57,540 --> 00:10:00,839
Services does we are a global cloud

226
00:10:00,839 --> 00:10:04,200
service that stores processes and also

227
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:07,620
streams video and audio content at scale

228
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:11,220
and how this works is we take in some

229
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:13,800
form of it video whether that's archival

230
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:16,860
content for video on demand or a live

231
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:17,700
stream

232
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:20,580
we then encode it which means we

233
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:23,580
compress and process the video file into

234
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:25,620
a playable format

235
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:27,899
then we also help customers distribute

236
00:10:27,899 --> 00:10:29,760
it such as streaming on their own

237
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:32,459
websites or using a Content distribution

238
00:10:32,459 --> 00:10:35,880
Network or CDN to scale Their audience

239
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:37,860
and we also provide different content

240
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:39,720
protection methods too such as

241
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:41,880
encrypting the content or providing

242
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:44,399
Integrations with digital Rights

243
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:48,000
Management systems that limit contents

244
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:52,019
playback on different systems

245
00:10:52,019 --> 00:10:54,899
and how and this isn't all that we do

246
00:10:54,899 --> 00:10:56,760
but it is

247
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:59,160
a sample of all of our informed features

248
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:02,700
and how Province fits into this is in

249
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:05,399
the processing bucket so you'd be able

250
00:11:05,399 --> 00:11:07,860
to sign your content with profitance and

251
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:09,779
then also take advantage of a lot of

252
00:11:09,779 --> 00:11:12,060
other features that Azure Media Services

253
00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:14,779
provides

254
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:17,220
and as Brendan mentioned all of this

255
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:19,620
information on how to do Providence that

256
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:22,140
is all public on the ctpa website there

257
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:24,420
is a public specs it's all version 1.2

258
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:26,279
right now and so there's not really a

259
00:11:26,279 --> 00:11:28,019
secret sauce of provenance

260
00:11:28,019 --> 00:11:31,560
but it is quite a complex process that

261
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:33,300
requires a lot of infrastructure

262
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:36,060
investment and continuous long-term

263
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:38,399
updates and maintenance we started with

264
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:40,680
1.0 January this year we're already on

265
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:43,560
1.2 so if you do the math it's a lot of

266
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:46,140
updates in one year so by using a Cloud

267
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:48,959
solution you can get Province but all

268
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:51,480
the benefits of cloud including lower

269
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:53,880
cost and easier and speedier deployment

270
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:56,640
and also less worries on maintenance and

271
00:11:56,640 --> 00:12:00,860
keeping up to date with the ctpa spec

272
00:12:01,079 --> 00:12:03,540
so with that what do we currently have

273
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:05,040
in our system

274
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:07,500
on the implementation side we are

275
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:11,519
compliant with the c2pa V 1.0 spec and

276
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:13,140
we're also uploading dating to the most

277
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:15,120
recent 1.2 version

278
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:17,820
we are also hashing the content manifest

279
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:20,579
uh the Manifest that's where all the

280
00:12:20,579 --> 00:12:22,920
information about a piece of content is

281
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:25,380
stored so we are basically transforming

282
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:28,380
that manifest into a different value

283
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:30,720
that can then be verified later on to

284
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:32,399
make sure nothing was changed in the

285
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:33,360
file

286
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:35,880
we are also integrated with azure

287
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:39,120
pivault so key vault is a service that

288
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:42,120
securely encrypts stores and manages all

289
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:45,060
your keys and secrets like passwords and

290
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:47,040
they also have Hardware integration as

291
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:49,500
well so it's actually Safe Keep Out uses

292
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:51,779
your certificate which shows that you

293
00:12:51,779 --> 00:12:53,519
are a legitimate organization that

294
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:55,680
you're verified and they sign this

295
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:57,660
previously hash manifest with all the

296
00:12:57,660 --> 00:12:59,459
important information with this

297
00:12:59,459 --> 00:13:01,920
certificate and this whole process can

298
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:04,680
then be undone on the end user side

299
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:07,760
where they can validate

300
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:10,139
when they actually view the Providence

301
00:13:10,139 --> 00:13:11,940
content

302
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:14,880
and we are also in what we call a

303
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:16,920
quote-unquote it's a loose term right

304
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:20,160
now private preview basically this is a

305
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:21,959
demo with a small group of customers

306
00:13:21,959 --> 00:13:24,360
where they try using our application

307
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:27,180
programmer interface or API

308
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:30,120
so we have the CBC in Radio Canada which

309
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:33,060
you'll hear from after me but we also

310
00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:35,339
have a company called router

311
00:13:35,339 --> 00:13:37,800
so router is a Content management system

312
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:40,380
for government organizations and

313
00:13:40,380 --> 00:13:43,380
provenance is of interest to governments

314
00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:45,180
understandably because they don't want

315
00:13:45,180 --> 00:13:46,860
the content that the outputs the public

316
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:49,860
to be manipulated and you can see a demo

317
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:51,899
that we have with router in the video on

318
00:13:51,899 --> 00:13:56,700
the ctpa's uh website c2k.org

319
00:13:56,700 --> 00:13:58,260
so

320
00:13:58,260 --> 00:13:59,760
that's what we currently have and what

321
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:01,620
we're doing now I want to talk about

322
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:03,779
what we're planning on doing moving

323
00:14:03,779 --> 00:14:05,959
forward

324
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:09,420
we do have a lot of feature updates that

325
00:14:09,420 --> 00:14:12,660
we're planning to update on so first of

326
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:14,339
all always keeping up to date with

327
00:14:14,339 --> 00:14:16,740
whichever cdpa spec is newly released

328
00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:19,320
that they're given as our current

329
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:22,440
Providence system is more a basic

330
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:24,540
preview version we're also trying to add

331
00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:26,459
in more features that are defined in

332
00:14:26,459 --> 00:14:28,440
this spec so Brandon mentioned like

333
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:31,019
different uh assertions claims about

334
00:14:31,019 --> 00:14:34,019
like whether that's like iptc related or

335
00:14:34,019 --> 00:14:36,360
like what transforms you've done things

336
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:37,440
like that

337
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:39,420
and we also want to make this more

338
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:41,639
customer facing and so that would

339
00:14:41,639 --> 00:14:43,860
include adding in an easy to use and

340
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:46,260
also easy to deploy user experience

341
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:49,019
and finally the hardest part is how we

342
00:14:49,019 --> 00:14:51,360
can educate customers on this and help

343
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:53,160
them understand and use the prominent

344
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:54,480
system

345
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:57,180
I mean from what you saw there is it

346
00:14:57,180 --> 00:14:58,740
could sound simple enough but when you

347
00:14:58,740 --> 00:15:00,060
actually do it there's a lot of

348
00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:01,980
intricacies there so we're working on

349
00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:04,760
creating a nice set of documentation

350
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:07,380
educational articles and also code

351
00:15:07,380 --> 00:15:10,820
samples to help along the way

352
00:15:11,180 --> 00:15:14,519
now I know this is much more of a high

353
00:15:14,519 --> 00:15:16,139
level overview of what we're planning on

354
00:15:16,139 --> 00:15:18,060
doing and I'm sure there's a lot of

355
00:15:18,060 --> 00:15:20,820
questions on uh how do you do this

356
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:22,920
specifically what the process is like

357
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:24,420
all of that

358
00:15:24,420 --> 00:15:26,639
um but I'm happy to share more but if

359
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:27,959
you are interested in learning more

360
00:15:27,959 --> 00:15:30,360
about this uh and or if you would like

361
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:32,339

journalism have presents on social media

416
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:11,940
like Twitter Facebook and YouTube and we

417
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:14,100
have a lot of project running on Tick

418
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:16,559
Tock and Instagram and all the the new

419
00:18:16,559 --> 00:18:20,340
feed the the new more younger stuff to

420
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:23,280
reach younger audience

421
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:27,840
um for us the c2pa uh where where we

422
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:30,120
want to focus on that presently as a

423
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:32,820
first step for our company is uh at the

424
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:35,520
if if we look at the first see the three

425
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:38,580
step where we can uh adding information

426
00:18:38,580 --> 00:18:41,460
in slupa is at the news Gathering when

427
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:45,120
we receive like images or when we took

428
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:47,880
images with our own camera but we we we

429
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:51,120
work with AFP wear or router where we we

430
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:53,700
took some images from there

431
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:57,480
um at the editing but for us we decide

432
00:18:57,480 --> 00:18:59,760
to focus on the publishing side that

433
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:02,220
mean where we took the asset is ready

434
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:05,340
and we sending that to another platform

435
00:19:05,340 --> 00:19:08,760
like Twitter or or on website

436
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:11,640
uh that's the place we we focus our POC

437
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:13,500
basically

438
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:16,500
um we do the test with the Azure Media

439
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:18,000
Services

440
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,900
um basically uh the the Red Square on my

441
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:24,480
uh on my drawing is uh the on-prem

442
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:27,780
facility uh when the asset is produced

443
00:19:27,780 --> 00:19:30,360
that means after the editing one is

444
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:33,360
ready to start we have a phase where we

445
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:35,820
encoded that that asset

446
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:38,100
um with multiple bit rate for Creative

447
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:42,059
video on demand asset on our website

448
00:19:42,059 --> 00:19:46,559
um basically all of the blue square is

449
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:49,200
the uh the Azure Media Services part

450
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:50,760
then

451
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:54,059
um Jay just explained before and for the

452
00:19:54,059 --> 00:19:56,820
moment is we run with the manual script

453
00:19:56,820 --> 00:19:59,400
like the transformation of the asset we

454
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:03,080
push the asset manually to the cloud

455
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:06,000
this workflows the puc is not automated

456
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,320
for the moment

457
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:11,160
uh basically the Azure Media Services uh

458
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:14,039
the process do the encryption of the

459
00:20:14,039 --> 00:20:16,740
metadata and manage the certificate for

460
00:20:16,740 --> 00:20:19,500
seal the information and we add

461
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:22,500
something that is not c2p related we we

462
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:24,780
use like a streaming endpoint to create

463
00:20:24,780 --> 00:20:28,580
like a VOD link

464
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:30,539
um Jay mentioned it on the presentation

465
00:20:30,539 --> 00:20:33,780
also the one of the player we can use to

466
00:20:33,780 --> 00:20:37,520
validate if the um the video asset have

467
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:41,760
correctly include the c2pa Manifest is

468
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:45,419
the ravner player the other web page

469
00:20:45,419 --> 00:20:49,559
where you can upload or on video link

470
00:20:49,559 --> 00:20:52,740
and try to play it on them I will show

471
00:20:52,740 --> 00:20:54,679
you what this look like

472
00:20:54,679 --> 00:20:56,520
basically

473
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:57,140
um

474
00:20:57,140 --> 00:21:01,260
uh basically that is uh one video I

475
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:04,500
uploaded on Azure and is ready to uh to

476
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:05,820
play it

477
00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:07,740
um you can see there if I start the

478
00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:09,059
video

479
00:21:09,059 --> 00:21:11,880
you can see there the small

480
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:12,539
um

481
00:21:12,539 --> 00:21:16,020
I is is in that is the implantation

482
00:21:16,020 --> 00:21:17,880
implantation the player for for the

483
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:21,260
moment if I click on them I can see then

484
00:21:21,260 --> 00:21:27,720
uh my video CBC c2p apuc is signed

485
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:30,840
um when but not when but the issue buy

486
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:33,059
that that is a it's me I need to work

487
00:21:33,059 --> 00:21:35,100
more to put the good information at the

488
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:38,400
good place and isandor said over AMS

489
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:41,340
Azure Media Services uh with the

490
00:21:41,340 --> 00:21:42,960
Prototype

491
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:44,640
um basically that is the information

492
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:47,700
then a user can see to validate the

493
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:50,220
provenance of the video here we can see

494
00:21:50,220 --> 00:21:51,659
all of the chain the chain is easy

495
00:21:51,659 --> 00:21:53,820
because I just take the asset and code

496
00:21:53,820 --> 00:21:57,240
it and put on a player but if I have

497
00:21:57,240 --> 00:22:00,120
more step than that as example if the

498
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:03,440
view come from another sources validated

499
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:06,600
I can see here the the the chain of the

500
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:07,679
validation

501
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:10,740
the chain of the provenance sorry if I

502
00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:13,799
took another web page is the same demo

503
00:22:13,799 --> 00:22:16,260
page but I upload another video on them

504
00:22:16,260 --> 00:22:18,960
this is the same video but without

505
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:22,679
passing over the c2pa process when I

506
00:22:22,679 --> 00:22:25,740
start the video or almost before you can

507
00:22:25,740 --> 00:22:28,559
see here the small I is in Orange and

508
00:22:28,559 --> 00:22:30,900
they will explain to a user oops sorry

509
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:33,419
they will explain to your user then did

510
00:22:33,419 --> 00:22:35,400
not have digital signature the video is

511
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:37,919
still play but the the customer at the

512
00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:40,260
end can said hmm maybe the sources is

513
00:22:40,260 --> 00:22:43,700
not good I need to validate

514
00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:45,980
um

515
00:22:46,980 --> 00:22:49,440
that is that the POC we made and we

516
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:51,539
continue to try to to play with it as

517
00:22:51,539 --> 00:22:54,419
example uh changing the the bit rate

518
00:22:54,419 --> 00:22:56,159
because you know for for creating a

519
00:22:56,159 --> 00:22:58,440
vldod asset and streaming it to over

520
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:01,620
HTTP uh live streaming uh we want to

521
00:23:01,620 --> 00:23:03,299
have multiple bit rate to add that to

522
00:23:03,299 --> 00:23:05,520
the internet that's the idea but all of

523
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:08,220
this mechanism looks like work

524
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:11,700
um after that uh as a solution engineer

525
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:15,000
I need to try to fit that in my uh in in

526
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,820
our own architecture basically they're

527
00:23:17,820 --> 00:23:21,360
they're the green square this part I

528
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:23,100
want to automate that and put that

529
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:26,460
somewhere in our own workflow it's quite

530
00:23:26,460 --> 00:23:28,919
difficult uh sorry for this slide is

531
00:23:28,919 --> 00:23:30,480
look like

532
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:33,240
but I will explain you fastly you can

533
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:35,780
see on this slide if you just

534
00:23:35,780 --> 00:23:38,460
step back a little bit you can see two

535
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:41,580
different workflow one for our news

536
00:23:41,580 --> 00:23:44,520
website the one on the bottom uh where

537
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:46,980
is all view the asset that means we

538
00:23:46,980 --> 00:23:49,620
create a video file with time duration

539
00:23:49,620 --> 00:23:53,100
we encode it and we encode it after that

540
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:55,500
and we send that to um to our platform

541
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:57,659
the other workflow is the odd the

542
00:23:57,659 --> 00:23:59,240
workflow and the blue one on the top

543
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:04,140
where we provide video for social media

544
00:24:04,140 --> 00:24:07,679
all of this workflow is is management is

545
00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:11,179
based on live feed that is more complex

546
00:24:11,179 --> 00:24:15,720
because uh we we not have like the tool

547
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:18,600
presently as a customer to and insert

548
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:21,720
the c2pa on a live feed

549
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:24,240
what we think and that's why we are

550
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:26,340
today like this is a something in

551
00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:29,580
evolution uh we we want to maybe replace

552
00:24:29,580 --> 00:24:32,220
the the green square we see before on

553
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:34,799
our pipeline there where all of our

554
00:24:34,799 --> 00:24:37,799
asset can be uh and just in Azure

555
00:24:37,799 --> 00:24:41,159
instead the the square of Amazon you see

556
00:24:41,159 --> 00:24:42,600
before that's the workflow we have

557
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:45,240
recently and after that staying that to

558
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:47,820
our CDN Akamai the the content

559
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:49,919
distribution Network and people can

560
00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:51,600
consume the video there

561
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:53,880
the problem with that is a big project

562
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:56,460
with our boat digital team in French and

563
00:24:56,460 --> 00:24:59,100
English that's why we look more for do

564
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:02,039
like a subset maybe of a r set as the

565
00:25:02,039 --> 00:25:04,620
beginning but that is not started for

566
00:25:04,620 --> 00:25:06,799
the moment but that could be like a a

567
00:25:06,799 --> 00:25:09,240
midterm solution

568
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:12,059
the other thing we're thinking is uh to

569
00:25:12,059 --> 00:25:15,240
implement on the live feed if the

570
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:17,580
technology go well and we can have an

571
00:25:17,580 --> 00:25:19,919
implementation in live we can do that

572
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:23,880
the the the the pro or or if like

573
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:27,179
Twitter go and chip in more in the

574
00:25:27,179 --> 00:25:30,120
development and on the Twitter media

575
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:31,919
Studio they can add the ability to add

576
00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:34,380
c2pa that could be another solution but

577
00:25:34,380 --> 00:25:36,659
that is another concern but basically

578
00:25:36,659 --> 00:25:38,039
it's a

579
00:25:38,039 --> 00:25:39,840
it's more like a challenge for the

580
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:41,760
moment to implement that to our workflow

581
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:43,320
and we don't really have the good

582
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:46,440
solution quick win we not find it

583
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:48,419
basically

584
00:25:48,419 --> 00:25:52,559
our edl implementation will be at the uh

585
00:25:52,559 --> 00:25:55,860
encoding level on-prem the the amount of

586
00:25:55,860 --> 00:25:59,520
video we we produce uh by day it could

587
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:01,380
be valuable for us to implement

588
00:26:01,380 --> 00:26:03,480
ourselves not Implement ourselves but

589
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:06,240
have like a on-prem solution where all

590
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:08,520
of the asset going out for publishing

591
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:12,960
will be passing over c2p that means uh

592
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:14,940
Brandon touch base a little bit about

593
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:16,620
that but that means we need to manage

594
00:26:16,620 --> 00:26:19,080
our own certificate at this point what

595
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:22,020
is the validation of our own certificate

596
00:26:22,020 --> 00:26:24,419
over the Internet after that is all of

597
00:26:24,419 --> 00:26:27,059
question we still have on the uh on the

598
00:26:27,059 --> 00:26:29,900
c2pa project

599
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:30,720
um

600
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:34,080
our next step basically uh as I said we

601
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:35,700
need to complete our first step

602
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:37,260
architecture implement the end

603
00:26:37,260 --> 00:26:40,020
implementation we continue also to

604
00:26:40,020 --> 00:26:42,419
testing the impact on our own player and

605
00:26:42,419 --> 00:26:45,059
workflow to adding this metadata on our

606
00:26:45,059 --> 00:26:46,220
video

607
00:26:46,220 --> 00:26:49,140
uh we want to automate basically this

608
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:51,360
this uh this workflow for production of

609
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:54,360
course and we really add the point to

610
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:57,240
socialize the c2pa and your other team

611
00:26:57,240 --> 00:27:00,360
like digital team management and to to

612
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:02,220
be involved with people we do the first

613
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:04,440
presentation to The Newsroom English

614
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:08,159
Newsroom this week and we we need to

615
00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:10,140
doing the same thing on the French side

616
00:27:10,140 --> 00:27:11,340
and

617
00:27:11,340 --> 00:27:14,039
I don't know when made next week also to

618
00:27:14,039 --> 00:27:15,840
be involved the journalists on this kind

619
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:18,000
of mentality because a good

620
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,520
implementation they will take part of to

621
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:23,279
insert the metadata maybe at before the

622
00:27:23,279 --> 00:27:26,820
editing or at the editing level

623
00:27:26,820 --> 00:27:29,279
and the other point is to uh start the

624
00:27:29,279 --> 00:27:31,980
wheel they presently we not put that in

625
00:27:31,980 --> 00:27:34,620
production even the fact then all of the

626
00:27:34,620 --> 00:27:36,299
player is not all of the players

627
00:27:36,299 --> 00:27:39,360
supported the small eye we see before we

628
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:42,120
want to start to produce video asset

629
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:44,700
with c2pa even people cannot see the

630
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:47,520
result at the end because the idea is to

631
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:51,419
to move to start the movement and also

632
00:27:51,419 --> 00:27:54,360
in the same idea adding this and this

633
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:56,220
this requirement to our procurement

634
00:27:56,220 --> 00:27:59,340
process to be able then when I buy the

635
00:27:59,340 --> 00:28:01,799
next video encoder I want to have the

636
00:28:01,799 --> 00:28:04,740
option to add the c2ba option to add the

637
00:28:04,740 --> 00:28:07,380
Manifest and Etc

638
00:28:07,380 --> 00:28:10,320
that's why we are in fastly the Brandon

639
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:11,940
told me you don't you just have 10

640
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:13,860
minutes I will try to doing that quick I

641
00:28:13,860 --> 00:28:15,779
know it's a lot of information but if

642
00:28:15,779 --> 00:28:17,700
you have questions feel free or you want

643
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:20,039
to discuss feel free to reach me uh you

644
00:28:20,039 --> 00:28:22,919
have your my email there and I'm still

645
00:28:22,919 --> 00:28:25,500
available in both language

646
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:27,480
great thank you very much David that was

647
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:31,200
excellent and uh yeah hopefully uh it's

648
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:34,559
given everyone an idea that cgba can

649
00:28:34,559 --> 00:28:36,120
actually be implemented in a real

650
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:37,559
Newsroom although there are still many

651
00:28:37,559 --> 00:28:39,960
questions to be answered so on that note

652
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:42,779
uh next Charlie are you there and

653
00:28:42,779 --> 00:28:45,539
hopefully Nigel as well

654
00:28:45,539 --> 00:28:48,059
oh yes Nigel I can see you there now so

655
00:28:48,059 --> 00:28:50,580
I need to make you uh so you can share

656
00:28:50,580 --> 00:28:52,380
hear me

657
00:28:52,380 --> 00:28:54,240
so if I can try I'm trying to start my

658
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:56,100
video I didn't oh I would say excellent

659
00:28:56,100 --> 00:28:57,240
excellent it wouldn't it wouldn't work

660
00:28:57,240 --> 00:28:59,159
one second ago great thank you I just

661
00:28:59,159 --> 00:29:00,980
turned you on

662
00:29:00,980 --> 00:29:05,100
so to speak so uh

663
00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:08,279
okay I'll begin so um I'm sorry I have

664
00:29:08,279 --> 00:29:10,580
to say could you please be fairly uh

665
00:29:10,580 --> 00:29:13,500
faster yeah we've got 15 minutes to do

666
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:16,080
you end Adobe okay yeah very quickly

667
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:17,400
then that's great

668
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:19,140
um so I'm nice to learn sure I work for

669
00:29:19,140 --> 00:29:22,860
BBC r d I'm a white uh the spectacled

670
00:29:22,860 --> 00:29:25,020
middle-aged man

671
00:29:25,020 --> 00:29:27,360
um and I I'll just take you very quickly

672
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:28,980
through what we're doing in a practical

673
00:29:28,980 --> 00:29:31,620
sense and then my colleague Charlie will

674
00:29:31,620 --> 00:29:33,480
talk about the sort of The Wider issues

675
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:34,740
of The Newsroom

676
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:37,380
so if I just share very quickly

677
00:29:37,380 --> 00:29:39,440
um

678
00:29:41,100 --> 00:29:43,860
I'll Point shout slow as well for you

679
00:29:43,860 --> 00:29:46,740
so this this partic this first one okay

680
00:29:46,740 --> 00:29:49,140
does that has that worked yes we can see

681
00:29:49,140 --> 00:29:51,600
it excellent okay I think I lost you

682
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:55,020
right so um so yeah so as I said this is

683
00:29:55,020 --> 00:29:57,419
BBC we participate in the in the

684
00:29:57,419 --> 00:29:59,460
technical work in c2pa both Charlie and

685
00:29:59,460 --> 00:30:00,480
I

686
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:03,720
so um our our particular

687
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:05,880
um Mission here was to sort of as we

688
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:07,440
developed the specification was first of

689
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:08,520
all to try and understand a

690
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:10,380
specification and scrutinize it

691
00:30:10,380 --> 00:30:11,760
technically so it could feed back and

692
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:14,340
understand what may or may not be be uh

693
00:30:14,340 --> 00:30:16,860
working with it so what we wanted to do

694
00:30:16,860 --> 00:30:18,960
is actually create some um ctpa

695
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:20,580
compliant content you know from scratch

696
00:30:20,580 --> 00:30:23,279
just using node JavaScript and just

697
00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:24,600
trying to implement these these

698
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:26,340
authenticated manifests which as you

699
00:30:26,340 --> 00:30:28,320
know are cryptographically authenticated

700
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:30,480
data structures

701
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:32,340
so we wanted to do this to add the

702
00:30:32,340 --> 00:30:34,200
specification development and test our

703
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:35,940
understanding and of course make sure

704
00:30:35,940 --> 00:30:37,679
that it didn't affect the content we can

705
00:30:37,679 --> 00:30:39,840
still play the files so this was our for

706
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:42,240
the first thing we sort of undertook

707
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:44,159
um and and it was successful we managed

708
00:30:44,159 --> 00:30:46,799
to uh produce files which colleagues um

709
00:30:46,799 --> 00:30:49,080
Partners within c2pa people like Adobe

710
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:51,240
trooping microphone Microsoft all

711
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:52,320
managed to

712
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:53,580
um play and we managed to play their

713
00:30:53,580 --> 00:30:55,620
content so that was the sort of big the

714
00:30:55,620 --> 00:30:58,020
big sort of first effort at trying to

715
00:30:58,020 --> 00:31:00,179
implement this thing from scratch

716
00:31:00,179 --> 00:31:01,980
and we ended up with a sort of basic

717
00:31:01,980 --> 00:31:04,500
command line tool in JavaScript so I'm

718
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:05,940
just showing a screenshot here rather

719
00:31:05,940 --> 00:31:07,080
than the whole thing because this is a

720
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:09,120
very sort of technical engineering

721
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:11,820
command line tool you know you type make

722
00:31:11,820 --> 00:31:14,159
a manifest it takes some content it goes

723
00:31:14,159 --> 00:31:16,380
through all of the process of adding

724
00:31:16,380 --> 00:31:19,260
assertions of doing the cryptography of

725
00:31:19,260 --> 00:31:20,940
binding in the content to the Manifest

726
00:31:20,940 --> 00:31:23,159
generating a manifest adding it to the

727
00:31:23,159 --> 00:31:25,380
file so what you see really would just

728
00:31:25,380 --> 00:31:27,419
be a lot of a lot of text coming back by

729
00:31:27,419 --> 00:31:29,640
to uh to verify the operations and and

730
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:31,260
tell me what the data structures are so

731
00:31:31,260 --> 00:31:33,120
I can actually debug it but at the end

732
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:34,380
of it I end up with a file with some

733
00:31:34,380 --> 00:31:37,320
ctpa content and I make sure I can play

734
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:39,899
it so that if you like was the step one

735
00:31:39,899 --> 00:31:42,659
has been achieved we're quite happy with

736
00:31:42,659 --> 00:31:44,760
that then we wanted to try and make a

737
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:47,220
second step which is to try and produce

738
00:31:47,220 --> 00:31:50,340
a more user-friendly demonstrator which

739
00:31:50,340 --> 00:31:52,799
is more Visual and more kind of looks

740
00:31:52,799 --> 00:31:54,600
more like a professional validator in

741
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:55,919
fact what we really wanted to do was

742
00:31:55,919 --> 00:31:59,159
produce some more um some libraries that

743
00:31:59,159 --> 00:32:01,320
we could build that we can to our ux

744
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:03,000
experts so they could build on it and do

745
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:06,179
some testing with um user experience and

746
00:32:06,179 --> 00:32:08,279
we wanted to be able to think about

747
00:32:08,279 --> 00:32:10,860
making a tool to generate content and

748
00:32:10,860 --> 00:32:12,179
explain to our journalists and our

749
00:32:12,179 --> 00:32:14,940
people in and our friends in news how

750
00:32:14,940 --> 00:32:18,720
how this works what it is conceptually

751
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:20,520
you know show them a range of assertions

752
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:22,260
these claims that say you know that we

753
00:32:22,260 --> 00:32:23,940
was produced by the BBC or was produced

754
00:32:23,940 --> 00:32:26,419
by some incoming contribution

755
00:32:26,419 --> 00:32:28,679
explore manifests and just be able to

756
00:32:28,679 --> 00:32:32,159
show them around so we um we started off

757
00:32:32,159 --> 00:32:35,460
uh just creating these libraries

758
00:32:35,460 --> 00:32:37,799
um and and so far we can we can exhibit

759
00:32:37,799 --> 00:32:39,779
we can use the libraries to look inside

760
00:32:39,779 --> 00:32:41,760
our content if I just quickly show you

761
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:44,820
another screen uh stop sharing and then

762
00:32:44,820 --> 00:32:48,059
re-share with my browser so that I can

763
00:32:48,059 --> 00:32:49,320
show you

764
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:50,580
um

765
00:32:50,580 --> 00:32:52,919
just take you quickly through

766
00:32:52,919 --> 00:32:55,380
the browser so here we have the project

767
00:32:55,380 --> 00:32:57,659
origin demonstrator

768
00:32:57,659 --> 00:32:59,760
um so I've fed in a file and the file

769
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:01,679
has been pre-processed with the earlier

770
00:33:01,679 --> 00:33:03,659
tool so we actually have sort of locally

771
00:33:03,659 --> 00:33:06,600
generated manifests to go into the file

772
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:08,700
if I go down people are not familiar

773
00:33:08,700 --> 00:33:10,860
with with mpeg-4 formats ignore all this

774
00:33:10,860 --> 00:33:13,200
these are just the boxes that arrive in

775
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:15,539
the file and eventually we get to a big

776
00:33:15,539 --> 00:33:17,100
box it's called a jump box that's a

777
00:33:17,100 --> 00:33:18,600
standard don't worry about that so we

778
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:20,760
have a manifest store and we can explore

779
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:23,340
what's in this this part of the file so

780
00:33:23,340 --> 00:33:24,360
I've got the rest of the file there's

781
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:26,340
video in it audio data samples but this

782
00:33:26,340 --> 00:33:27,960
is just the Manifest part that it's

783
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:30,059
pulled out and allows me to explore it

784
00:33:30,059 --> 00:33:32,159
look into the assertion store so for

785
00:33:32,159 --> 00:33:33,360
instance I can see that there's an

786
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:35,340
assertion here and these have been the

787
00:33:35,340 --> 00:33:37,440
actions that have been created by me so

788
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:40,140
I've put in a CPA to a correct a created

789
00:33:40,140 --> 00:33:42,600
action and when it was published when it

790
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:45,000
was produced and that kind of thing so

791
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,200
that's really what we've been trying to

792
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:47,820
do is build this library now so we can

793
00:33:47,820 --> 00:33:50,760
have a more visual exploratory view of

794
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:52,860
manifest that we create and ultimate

795
00:33:52,860 --> 00:33:55,820
they have tools to create and validate

796
00:33:55,820 --> 00:33:58,440
manifests so we can sort of evangelize

797
00:33:58,440 --> 00:34:00,659
and explain what's going on as we go

798
00:34:00,659 --> 00:34:03,059
into news which is a good point to hand

799
00:34:03,059 --> 00:34:04,860
over to Charlie because Charlie his

800
00:34:04,860 --> 00:34:07,320
Newsroom expert so he can tell me he can

801
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:10,139
talk to you about how we might think

802
00:34:10,139 --> 00:34:11,339
um how we might think about

803
00:34:11,339 --> 00:34:13,918
incorporating this kind of process into

804
00:34:13,918 --> 00:34:18,319
our Newsroom so if I stop sharing

805
00:34:18,599 --> 00:34:20,879
and I think that should be enough for

806
00:34:20,879 --> 00:34:24,480
excellent thank you thanks Angel

807
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:26,460
um hi I'm Charlie

808
00:34:26,460 --> 00:34:29,520
um I'm a white bearded man with very

809
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:30,960
messy hair today

810
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:33,418
um and yeah just very quickly just

811
00:34:33,418 --> 00:34:35,159
wanted to go over some of the options we

812
00:34:35,159 --> 00:34:38,219
we think we have in our in our workflow

813
00:34:38,219 --> 00:34:41,219
um so we've we've sort of decided that

814
00:34:41,219 --> 00:34:42,980
social is where we want to concentrate

815
00:34:42,980 --> 00:34:45,659
uh because social is where we see the

816
00:34:45,659 --> 00:34:46,500
most

817
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:49,560
the the biggest opportunity for c2pa and

818
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:51,239
media provenance in general making a

819
00:34:51,239 --> 00:34:52,500
difference

820
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:55,139
um just because uh when we put things

821
00:34:55,139 --> 00:34:56,760
out on our own website

822
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:59,099
um we have things like TLS and

823
00:34:59,099 --> 00:35:01,320
certificates to fall back on

824
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:04,680
um and so for us just similar to David's

825
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:08,280
um uh explanation as well it it's trying

826
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:10,920
to work out where we put our

827
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:13,980
um where we put our c2pa process so we

828
00:35:13,980 --> 00:35:15,599
think it's probably most likely that

829
00:35:15,599 --> 00:35:18,240
we'll start at this end of of our

830
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:19,560
diagram

831
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:22,260
um integrating hopefully with the

832
00:35:22,260 --> 00:35:25,619
nonlinear video editors that we use

833
00:35:25,619 --> 00:35:28,560
um the photo editors that we use to

834
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:31,440
um to embed ctpa manifests into our

835
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:32,700
workflows

836
00:35:32,700 --> 00:35:34,619
um and typically this is this is where

837
00:35:34,619 --> 00:35:37,020
our workflows start when we're putting a

838
00:35:37,020 --> 00:35:38,579
package out that's specific to social

839
00:35:38,579 --> 00:35:39,900
media

840
00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:42,540
um which is uh generally

841
00:35:42,540 --> 00:35:44,099
um what we try and do

842
00:35:44,099 --> 00:35:45,839
um so when we go to Twitter we'll cut

843
00:35:45,839 --> 00:35:48,060
something specific to Twitter

844
00:35:48,060 --> 00:35:50,160
um but what we'd really like to do is

845
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:52,200
with all of the the prototyping work

846
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:54,480
we've done start embedding stuff further

847
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:56,460
back in our workflow so as we come back

848
00:35:56,460 --> 00:35:58,200
in the workflow into our video Asset

849
00:35:58,200 --> 00:35:59,520
Management systems and image Management

850
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:02,220
Systems these are things that in the BBC

851
00:36:02,220 --> 00:36:05,640
are built and run by the BBC

852
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:06,660
um and so we've got the option

853
00:36:06,660 --> 00:36:09,540
opportunity there to customize them and

854
00:36:09,540 --> 00:36:12,540
to start putting c2pa manifests in there

855
00:36:12,540 --> 00:36:15,780
so we can get more detail out into

856
00:36:15,780 --> 00:36:18,300
um uh at an earlier point so maybe we

857
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:19,920
can get details about

858
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:21,839
um the journalists working on it things

859
00:36:21,839 --> 00:36:24,960
like that and then eventually

860
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:26,640
um we are hoping that we'll start seeing

861
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:27,900
some of our ingesting contribution

862
00:36:27,900 --> 00:36:31,020
sources including c2pa data so we can

863
00:36:31,020 --> 00:36:32,640
get that real provenance chain that

864
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:34,619
tells us even more about where the

865
00:36:34,619 --> 00:36:35,940
content came from

866
00:36:35,940 --> 00:36:38,660
thank you

867
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,520
that was great Charlie thank you for uh

868
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:44,220
being very succinct and uh to Nigel as

869
00:36:44,220 --> 00:36:46,500
well so it was very informative but also

870
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:49,740
very succinct so now uh hopefully we can

871
00:36:49,740 --> 00:36:51,960
go a few minutes into the next session

872
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:54,420
because uh unfortunately we had one of

873
00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:56,579
our panelists drop out due to catching

874
00:36:56,579 --> 00:37:00,240
kovid but uh we still want to have lots

875
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:01,619
of time for the AI session because it's

876
00:37:01,619 --> 00:37:03,420
a really interesting topic but we do

877
00:37:03,420 --> 00:37:05,220
have some great speakers from the

878
00:37:05,220 --> 00:37:07,800
content authenticity initiative so uh

879
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:10,020
Gavin would you like to start off and

880
00:37:10,020 --> 00:37:13,520
then peer will come afterwards and leave

881
00:37:14,359 --> 00:37:15,900
sure

882
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:18,839
um here I'm gonna share hopefully you

883
00:37:18,839 --> 00:37:20,880
can see that

884
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:22,740
yes we can

885
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:26,579
okay so I'm Gavin peacock I'm a white

886
00:37:26,579 --> 00:37:30,000
male with pearly gray hair and uh I am a

887
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,099
principal scientist at Adobe I'm all

888
00:37:32,099 --> 00:37:33,780
working on the content authenticity

889
00:37:33,780 --> 00:37:35,700
initiative and what I wanted to do was

890
00:37:35,700 --> 00:37:38,339
give you a really brief overview of what

891
00:37:38,339 --> 00:37:40,320
we are doing with open source so that

892
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:42,180
you're aware of uh this effort that

893
00:37:42,180 --> 00:37:44,760
we've made available to the public

894
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:46,380
and

895
00:37:46,380 --> 00:37:49,560
um so our goal is to encourage the rapid

896
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:51,839
adoption of c2pa and help people be

897
00:37:51,839 --> 00:37:54,839
informed uh and also develop our own

898
00:37:54,839 --> 00:37:56,220
applications so the tools that we're

899
00:37:56,220 --> 00:37:58,020
showing you uh we have uh used to

900
00:37:58,020 --> 00:37:59,940
develop our own applications at the core

901
00:37:59,940 --> 00:38:01,859
of all of this is a thing we call the

902
00:38:01,859 --> 00:38:03,780
c2pa rest SDK

903
00:38:03,780 --> 00:38:06,060
and what that is is an open source

904
00:38:06,060 --> 00:38:08,339
implementation of a significant part of

905
00:38:08,339 --> 00:38:10,560
the ctpa specification it's not

906
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:14,820
everything but it's a lot and it is able

907
00:38:14,820 --> 00:38:17,280
to run cross-platform so it runs in

908
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:20,339
browsers on mobile desktop server

909
00:38:20,339 --> 00:38:22,260
environment and embedded so it enables

910
00:38:22,260 --> 00:38:23,339
all of those different types of

911
00:38:23,339 --> 00:38:25,800
environments to be able to work

912
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:28,260
and the workflows that we support are

913
00:38:28,260 --> 00:38:30,780
creation and signing of c2pa manifests

914
00:38:30,780 --> 00:38:32,760
embedding those manifests in a various

915
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:34,560
forms of media

916
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:36,540
it also supports cloud and sidecar

917
00:38:36,540 --> 00:38:38,220
manifests so you don't have to embed the

918
00:38:38,220 --> 00:38:39,839
content

919
00:38:39,839 --> 00:38:42,000
um and can parse and validate running

920
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,680
through the full Suite of c2pa

921
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:46,020
validation on the the data that we have

922
00:38:46,020 --> 00:38:48,540
reporting on that and doing another

923
00:38:48,540 --> 00:38:49,740
thing you don't see as much which is

924
00:38:49,740 --> 00:38:51,660
building uh the Trees of this

925
00:38:51,660 --> 00:38:53,579
information so if you have existing

926
00:38:53,579 --> 00:38:55,200
flange you add it to other content and

927
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:57,380
start building composite information

928
00:38:57,380 --> 00:38:59,400
that can build this whole tree of

929
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:01,260
information within c2pa and we support

930
00:39:01,260 --> 00:39:04,079
that and you'll see more of that when uh

931
00:39:04,079 --> 00:39:08,040
Pia demonstrates after this we support a

932
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:09,839
wide range of media formats that is

933
00:39:09,839 --> 00:39:12,599
expanding we started with JPEG and PNG

934
00:39:12,599 --> 00:39:15,720
we're in the process of adding Tiff and

935
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:19,020
dng formats we also support a wide

936
00:39:19,020 --> 00:39:21,900
variety of vmm bmff based formats

937
00:39:21,900 --> 00:39:26,720
including heic MP4 mov and avif

938
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:30,140
to some degree

939
00:39:30,780 --> 00:39:33,420
uh the code is built in in Rust

940
00:39:33,420 --> 00:39:35,220
currently and there's a number of

941
00:39:35,220 --> 00:39:37,859
reasons that we use that performance and

942
00:39:37,859 --> 00:39:41,160
uh memory safety and uh portability to

943
00:39:41,160 --> 00:39:43,260
provide range of platforms and that's

944
00:39:43,260 --> 00:39:47,400
proved very good on top of the rust SDK

945
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:49,380
we have two other open source projects

946
00:39:49,380 --> 00:39:52,740
uh one is the JS SDK and one is the c2pa

947
00:39:52,740 --> 00:39:56,280
tool the JS SDK supports development in

948
00:39:56,280 --> 00:39:58,740
JavaScript for in browser applications

949
00:39:58,740 --> 00:40:01,140
and viewing content it is a fully

950
00:40:01,140 --> 00:40:03,180
client-side so what we've done is we've

951
00:40:03,180 --> 00:40:06,480
taken that Java the the core SDK wrapped

952
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:08,220
it in webassembly and it runs on the

953
00:40:08,220 --> 00:40:10,619
client which is great because you can uh

954
00:40:10,619 --> 00:40:12,119
you know view video and other things

955
00:40:12,119 --> 00:40:14,880
that way and it comes with a number of

956
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:16,800
UI examples for how you should build

957
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:19,200
stuff inside of the browser according to

958
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:21,240
the cgpa standards

959
00:40:21,240 --> 00:40:23,720
uh we also provide a command line tool

960
00:40:23,720 --> 00:40:26,220
which is able to create claims and

961
00:40:26,220 --> 00:40:28,440
verify them simply by passing in Json so

962
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:30,660
it does not require software development

963
00:40:30,660 --> 00:40:32,460
to use this you can just take it off the

964
00:40:32,460 --> 00:40:33,380
shelf

965
00:40:33,380 --> 00:40:36,240
for desktop or server environments and

966
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:39,000
it builds in Linux Mac OS window and

967
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:40,980
windows

968
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:43,200
so with that set of tools we're able to

969
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:46,079
support desktop applications uh

970
00:40:46,079 --> 00:40:47,940
applications in the browser via the JS

971
00:40:47,940 --> 00:40:51,960
SDK Services which have been largely

972
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:54,720
built on ctpa tool but can also directly

973
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:58,859
call the SDK and embedded environments

974
00:40:58,859 --> 00:41:02,099
and examples of that are Photoshop which

975
00:41:02,099 --> 00:41:04,320
Pia will show you along with our verify

976
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:06,420
site which is a website built on the JS

977
00:41:06,420 --> 00:41:07,760
SDK

978
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:10,980
adobe's stock service is using the c2pa

979
00:41:10,980 --> 00:41:12,839
tool to sign every image coming out of

980
00:41:12,839 --> 00:41:15,780
the stock which is Thousands per day and

981
00:41:15,780 --> 00:41:19,079
we also demonstrated recently a Nikon

982
00:41:19,079 --> 00:41:21,359
cameras and the embedded environment

983
00:41:21,359 --> 00:41:24,960
being able to use the same SDK there as

984
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:26,820
well as iOS applications that can be

985
00:41:26,820 --> 00:41:29,000
built that way

986
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,980
and these tools as I said are all

987
00:41:31,980 --> 00:41:35,300
available on open source today

988
00:41:35,300 --> 00:41:36,960
opensource.contentauthenticity.org on

989
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:39,359
GitHub content auth and we have a

990
00:41:39,359 --> 00:41:43,020
Discord Channel I'm allowing you to talk

991
00:41:43,020 --> 00:41:45,300
and communicate with us and now I will

992
00:41:45,300 --> 00:41:47,160
pass it over to Piet who's going to show

993
00:41:47,160 --> 00:41:50,760
you how this all looks

994
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:53,099
thank you Kevin

995
00:41:53,099 --> 00:41:56,599
let me share my screen

996
00:42:06,300 --> 00:42:10,140
okay great so I'm Pia I'm a white woman

997
00:42:10,140 --> 00:42:13,320
with brown hair bangs and glasses I lead

998
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:15,180
uh product design for the content

999
00:42:15,180 --> 00:42:16,680
authenticity initiative and I also

1000
00:42:16,680 --> 00:42:20,220
co-chaired the c2pa ux test course and

1001
00:42:20,220 --> 00:42:21,839
just to confirm everyone can see that I

1002
00:42:21,839 --> 00:42:23,940
have Photoshop already opened

1003
00:42:23,940 --> 00:42:25,740
great Okay so

1004
00:42:25,740 --> 00:42:28,619
thank you uh this is a photo of me and

1005
00:42:28,619 --> 00:42:30,660
our product manager Andrew K back when

1006
00:42:30,660 --> 00:42:32,420
we were at Adobe Max a couple weeks ago

1007
00:42:32,420 --> 00:42:34,740
interestingly this photo is actually an

1008
00:42:34,740 --> 00:42:38,700
example of uh the c2pa SDK running on

1009
00:42:38,700 --> 00:42:40,680
the Nikon G9 camera

1010
00:42:40,680 --> 00:42:42,119
we'll come back to what that actually

1011
00:42:42,119 --> 00:42:44,220
looks like in a moment uh but I'm going

1012
00:42:44,220 --> 00:42:45,359
to take you through

1013
00:42:45,359 --> 00:42:46,920
um just you know how our our

1014
00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:49,920
implementation works for anyone using

1015
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:52,020
the latest version of Adobe Photoshop

1016
00:42:52,020 --> 00:42:54,420
and is interested in securing their

1017
00:42:54,420 --> 00:42:57,000
attribution and history data so our tool

1018
00:42:57,000 --> 00:43:00,660
in uh the Adobe ecosystem is called

1019
00:43:00,660 --> 00:43:04,619
content credentials and let's see I

1020
00:43:04,619 --> 00:43:06,420
gotta understand

1021
00:43:06,420 --> 00:43:09,480
okay the way to enable content

1022
00:43:09,480 --> 00:43:13,020
credentials for a given document is

1023
00:43:13,020 --> 00:43:15,180
um through our panel but we can also

1024
00:43:15,180 --> 00:43:18,480
right click any open document to enable

1025
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:21,000
and once you've turned this on we have

1026
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:24,420
visual indication that this is running

1027
00:43:24,420 --> 00:43:27,240
so from our panel you can see all the

1028
00:43:27,240 --> 00:43:28,560
attribution information that we

1029
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:32,339
currently offer and you can even preview

1030
00:43:32,339 --> 00:43:33,839
it

1031
00:43:33,839 --> 00:43:36,960
um as it will appear once your content

1032
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:39,720
is exported so you can see that my name

1033
00:43:39,720 --> 00:43:43,079
appears as it is entered into my Adobe

1034
00:43:43,079 --> 00:43:46,680
profile there's also uh social media and

1035
00:43:46,680 --> 00:43:49,859
web3 accounts that can help tie me

1036
00:43:49,859 --> 00:43:51,780
closer to my content and offer an

1037
00:43:51,780 --> 00:43:54,480
identity reference for anyone viewing my

1038
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:58,020
work and to manage my connected accounts

1039
00:43:58,020 --> 00:44:01,740
I simply go to whoops open in the wrong

1040
00:44:01,740 --> 00:44:05,280
Place uh this connected accounts

1041
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:06,599
websites

1042
00:44:06,599 --> 00:44:09,540
um web3 is great for offering nft

1043
00:44:09,540 --> 00:44:11,220
creative attribution we have a couple

1044
00:44:11,220 --> 00:44:13,380
supported marketplaces that can

1045
00:44:13,380 --> 00:44:15,839
visualize uh content credentials when

1046
00:44:15,839 --> 00:44:17,960
added let me go ahead and actually

1047
00:44:17,960 --> 00:44:21,300
quickly add my behance profile

1048
00:44:21,300 --> 00:44:23,700
come back and refresh this and you can

1049
00:44:23,700 --> 00:44:26,520
see my social media links update in my

1050
00:44:26,520 --> 00:44:29,400
content credentials uh additionally to

1051
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:32,700
Identity information I can decide to

1052
00:44:32,700 --> 00:44:34,619
include my edits and activity which is

1053
00:44:34,619 --> 00:44:37,500
basically the actions I take on my open

1054
00:44:37,500 --> 00:44:39,839
documents these are high level

1055
00:44:39,839 --> 00:44:41,880
categories like you find in the the

1056
00:44:41,880 --> 00:44:44,220
latest version of the cqba spec that

1057
00:44:44,220 --> 00:44:46,619
give a general indication of what has

1058
00:44:46,619 --> 00:44:49,260
happened to an image along the way

1059
00:44:49,260 --> 00:44:52,319
you can also see that anything I bring

1060
00:44:52,319 --> 00:44:54,180
into this document will appear in the

1061
00:44:54,180 --> 00:44:56,520
assets section and again because that

1062
00:44:56,520 --> 00:44:58,560
Nikon photo already has attribution in

1063
00:44:58,560 --> 00:45:00,119
history data I have a clear indication

1064
00:45:00,119 --> 00:45:03,240
of that uh let me go ahead and just

1065
00:45:03,240 --> 00:45:07,859
close this for a moment to

1066
00:45:07,859 --> 00:45:12,180
be able to embed an adobe stock image I

1067
00:45:12,180 --> 00:45:15,480
downloaded and as Gavin just said uh

1068
00:45:15,480 --> 00:45:19,140
stock also runs the c2pa SDK

1069
00:45:19,140 --> 00:45:21,480
I'm going to quickly remix these

1070
00:45:21,480 --> 00:45:22,740
together

1071
00:45:22,740 --> 00:45:26,339
so that it looks like this photo is

1072
00:45:26,339 --> 00:45:29,460
appearing on this person's screen

1073
00:45:29,460 --> 00:45:31,140
and now when I preview my contact

1074
00:45:31,140 --> 00:45:33,420
credentials once more you can see that I

1075
00:45:33,420 --> 00:45:35,700
have uh both assets

1076
00:45:35,700 --> 00:45:38,160
um that have been imported combined and

1077
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:40,079
uh I've performed the size and position

1078
00:45:40,079 --> 00:45:41,940
adjustments

1079
00:45:41,940 --> 00:45:45,119
so I want to actually export my image

1080
00:45:45,119 --> 00:45:48,000
now I'll go to export as and we have a

1081
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,099
section for Content credentials

1082
00:45:50,099 --> 00:45:53,700
to include my attribution data I can

1083
00:45:53,700 --> 00:45:56,040
select to publish to content credentials

1084
00:45:56,040 --> 00:45:57,980
cloud or attach to the file directly

1085
00:45:57,980 --> 00:46:00,660
content credentials cloud is a service

1086
00:46:00,660 --> 00:46:03,420
that we offer it's a public persistence

1087
00:46:03,420 --> 00:46:06,720
cloud storage for my attribution data it

1088
00:46:06,720 --> 00:46:08,880
helps keep my file size small but it

1089
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:12,119
also provides resiliency if my data is

1090
00:46:12,119 --> 00:46:14,880
ever stripped from my file we have a way

1091
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:16,920
to recover it through our verify website

1092
00:46:16,920 --> 00:46:19,859
which we'll look at momentarily

1093
00:46:19,859 --> 00:46:20,940
um and then of course I can always

1094
00:46:20,940 --> 00:46:22,800
select none if I don't want to include

1095
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:25,380
this data uh so in this way I'm always

1096
00:46:25,380 --> 00:46:27,359
in control of you know when and how I

1097
00:46:27,359 --> 00:46:29,700
want to share my attribution information

1098
00:46:29,700 --> 00:46:32,700
so let me go ahead and Export we'll call

1099
00:46:32,700 --> 00:46:35,839
this uh remix

1100
00:46:36,060 --> 00:46:37,619
okay

1101
00:46:37,619 --> 00:46:42,660
and um we do have uh just a few

1102
00:46:42,660 --> 00:46:45,380
ways to help manage the overall workflow

1103
00:46:45,380 --> 00:46:49,440
so in history and content credentials

1104
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:53,220
preferences uh folks can set default

1105
00:46:53,220 --> 00:46:54,960
settings for document and Export

1106
00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:57,000
settings so that way they can always

1107
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:58,859
have this enabled for new and saved

1108
00:46:58,859 --> 00:47:01,560
documents to continue their edit and

1109
00:47:01,560 --> 00:47:04,500
activity history uh

1110
00:47:04,500 --> 00:47:06,180
likewise of course we recommend

1111
00:47:06,180 --> 00:47:08,480
publishing the content credentials Cloud

1112
00:47:08,480 --> 00:47:12,060
to ensure that data resiliency if um

1113
00:47:12,060 --> 00:47:15,780
your your data is ever stripped

1114
00:47:15,780 --> 00:47:19,680
and now let's go ahead to actually view

1115
00:47:19,680 --> 00:47:22,980
what we just created uh on verify

1116
00:47:22,980 --> 00:47:26,099
and we select the image we just made so

1117
00:47:26,099 --> 00:47:30,359
verify is a way to inspect any contents

1118
00:47:30,359 --> 00:47:33,180
content credentials we can see an

1119
00:47:33,180 --> 00:47:35,880
overview of the ingredients that make up

1120
00:47:35,880 --> 00:47:38,540
that image and we can even perform

1121
00:47:38,540 --> 00:47:41,099
visual inspections of different versions

1122
00:47:41,099 --> 00:47:44,640
to see what has changed over time

1123
00:47:44,640 --> 00:47:46,740
and if I dig in a little bit more to our

1124
00:47:46,740 --> 00:47:49,140
ingredients here's that Nikon photo you

1125
00:47:49,140 --> 00:47:52,079
can see it was signed by Nikon

1126
00:47:52,079 --> 00:47:54,480
um uh captured back in October during

1127
00:47:54,480 --> 00:47:57,060
Adobe Max there's also additional exit

1128
00:47:57,060 --> 00:48:00,060
information like camera and shot details

1129
00:48:00,060 --> 00:48:02,339
uh likewise if I look at the Adobe stock

1130
00:48:02,339 --> 00:48:04,920
image we can even see there's a link

1131
00:48:04,920 --> 00:48:07,500
back to where this image lives on stock

1132
00:48:07,500 --> 00:48:09,960
so my audience can decide to license

1133
00:48:09,960 --> 00:48:12,020
this photo if they're interested

1134
00:48:12,020 --> 00:48:16,619
and so this Composites uh provides my

1135
00:48:16,619 --> 00:48:19,319
viewers now with a complete record of

1136
00:48:19,319 --> 00:48:21,980
verifiable origins of how it came to be

1137
00:48:21,980 --> 00:48:25,200
last thing I want to show is how to

1138
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:28,440
recover your lost data so I just took a

1139
00:48:28,440 --> 00:48:31,380
screenshot and dropped it in to verify

1140
00:48:31,380 --> 00:48:33,839
and now of course you can see that I no

1141
00:48:33,839 --> 00:48:36,180
longer have content credentials for my

1142
00:48:36,180 --> 00:48:39,540
my image but because I just exported it

1143
00:48:39,540 --> 00:48:42,300
to the content credentials Cloud I can

1144
00:48:42,300 --> 00:48:44,280
perform a search on the cloud to find

1145
00:48:44,280 --> 00:48:48,240
possible matches based based on a visual

1146
00:48:48,240 --> 00:48:50,339
similarity search

1147
00:48:50,339 --> 00:48:52,920
um and of course here it is again and so

1148
00:48:52,920 --> 00:48:55,440
with content credentials cloud my data

1149
00:48:55,440 --> 00:48:58,500
is always resilient and accessible

1150
00:48:58,500 --> 00:49:02,579
uh so this is actually our capture edits

1151
00:49:02,579 --> 00:49:04,380
publish workflow to help establish

1152
00:49:04,380 --> 00:49:06,780
Providence Trails for Creative works

1153
00:49:06,780 --> 00:49:08,940
from the content authenticity initiative

1154
00:49:08,940 --> 00:49:11,720
thank you

1155
00:49:11,880 --> 00:49:13,980
that was great thank you very much

1156
00:49:13,980 --> 00:49:17,460
Pierre and Gavin for again compressing

1157
00:49:17,460 --> 00:49:19,020
so much information into such a short

1158
00:49:19,020 --> 00:49:21,839
time so I hope everyone was able to take

1159
00:49:21,839 --> 00:49:23,579
that in we will be publishing recordings

1160
00:49:23,579 --> 00:49:26,099
of these sessions uh so if anyone wants

1161
00:49:26,099 --> 00:49:27,300
to go through and

1162
00:49:27,300 --> 00:49:29,040
soak in the information a bit more

1163
00:49:29,040 --> 00:49:31,020
slowly where you can press pause then

1164
00:49:31,020 --> 00:49:33,420
feel free to go through that but uh

1165
00:49:33,420 --> 00:49:36,780
again thank you to both of you and uh to

1166
00:49:36,780 --> 00:49:39,119
