Abstract:
In the current social and technological context, the proliferation of content creation led to easy spreading of misinformation and fake content. This poses an important threat to individuals and even countries or democracy itself. This paper presents a novel proposal for ensuring content provenance and authenticity by leveraging blockchain technology. Besides blockchain, we make use of digital signatures and signature preservation services, integrated through standard interfaces. The proposed framework is designed to accommodate various content formats: text, image and video. After a comparison with similar solutions, we also detail a discussion analyzing limitations, opportunities and advantages or our approach. To sum up, the proposed framework outlined in this paper offers a robust and standard-compliant mechanism to ensure the provenance and authenticity of digital content, thereby addressing the pressing challenge of disinformation.

# Section I. Introduction

Copyright represents a subset of intellectual property that helps shield content creators from any attempts by other parties to falsely claim or exploit their creations. A consistent series of legislative elements [1– **2] and**
standards [3] have been defined to provide mechanisms for ensuring copyright protection. Despite all this effort, there are circumstances in which copyrights can be violated, with the original information being altered to produce material that serves the interests of malicious entities. In the current geopolitical context, a great deal of fake news has been produced to destabilize the economy [4]. Furthermore, fake news was also used to sway the opinions of specific segments of population from certain regions [5], or even countries. Such a case was the US elections of 2016 [6]. These factors emphasize of the significance of both copyright protection and content authenticity protection. Copyright protects the ownership and exploitation of a creation. Content authenticity aims to verify its integrity and trust, connecting the content to the means and tools with which it was created, as well as to its creator. Safeguarding the content authenticity turns out to be a crucial supplementary mechanism for copyright protection, as the authentication of the content at the time of creation can prevent forbidden modifications. Likewise, in some cases, it enables the identification of variations of the original content generated by other actors. Numerous organizations involved in content production or content production technology development have recognized this need and expressed interest in collaborating to develop standards, regulations, and mechanisms for safeguarding the content's authenticity. The Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity (C2PA), the Content Authenticity Initiative (CAI), and Project Origin represent several of the groups that have been established to achieve the previously mentioned goal.

The main purpose of this paper is to present a new proposal for ensuring content provenance and authenticity. Our approach is flexible regarding content formats, being compliant against relevant standards, and uses a distributed trust through blockchain technology. Besides this, we involve a standard long-term preservation service for conserving the status of digital signatures applied on the content.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section II presents the most relevant work done in the field of content provenance and authenticity (CPA). Afterwards, our proposal is described in detail in Section III.

Section IV lays down a discussion on the main challenges of a CPA framework. Finally, Section V presents paper's conclusions.

# Section Ii. State Of The Art

From a technical perspective, there are different mechanisms through which the protection of content authenticity can be ensured, as following:
Applying digital signatures over content, thus providing the possibility of verifying data integrity and validating the signer's identity; The use of watermarks in the form of unique identifiers integrated into the content, which will allow the identification of the issuer or the unauthorized use; Storing an identifier (e.g.: hash value) or a set of identifiers, specific to the content, in the blockchain, thereby providing a decentralized proof of authorship and enabling validation of content authenticity at any time [7].

### A. C2Pa **Ecosystem**

Digital signatures, a technology adopted at an accelerated pace, especially as a result of the distancing measures imposed during the Covid-19 pandemic, but with multiple benefits, is the chosen variant of the Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity (C2PA). These signatures are a cryptographic mechanism primary used to achieve encapsulation proposed in their specification [8]. The C2PA Consortium is a public standards development group that aims to certify the origin and history of online media content. It offers a set of standardized technical specifications that outline a framework for attesting the provenance of digital information. C2PA Consortium work is meant to be used by content creators, publishers, publications, media platforms, as well as ordinary consumers. The steering committee of C 2 PA is represented by companies such as Adobe, Google, Microsoft, Intel, and BBC. In addition, the collaboration known as Content Authenticity Initiative (CAI), which is headed by Adobe, facilitates the adoption of C 2 PA credentials by creating opensource software applications in compliance with the specified guidelines.

According to the C2PA ecosystem, each actor who creates or modifies digital content will produce one or more assertions **regarding the date, location, and type of actions performed on that specific asset. The resulting**
statements are arranged into a container called *assertion store***. In the next step, the assertions are referenced** through a component known as *claim*. Through this *claim***, a signature is applied to the previously created** assertions, using the actor's private key. Additionally, the specification allows the signer to include a timestamp as proof that the signature existed at a particular point in time. Subsequently, the three components that reflect the identity of the content and its history - the *claim*, the *assertion store***, and the**
claim signature - are arranged in a structure termed as the *C2PA manifest***. Ultimately, the manifest is**
embedded within the file asset determined by its type (e.g.: JPEG, PNG, PDF, etc.). Similarly, the standard allows manifest structures to be added for every operation that is performed on the material afterward.

One of the first approaches that suggests using blockchain-specific mechanisms to thwart fake news and propaganda is referred to as *Provenator* **[9]. The system has the main objective of proving the source of the**
original content. It accomplishes this by leveraging the immutable and distributed ledger storage of the hash of the digital resource. The structure used is compliant with the PREMIS (Preservation Metadata:
Implementation Strategies) provenance model. The same digital data will always produce the same digest when applying the hash function . Considering that, this feature is excellent when searching for the original content, but detrimental when trying to identify samples of altered content. For instance, changing a single pixel in a picture will produce an entirely new digest.

f A decentralized data management framework is outlined in [10] to guarantee the protection and control of user data. The proposed solution is primarily aimed at eliminating the third parties and agents that most companies and digital content owners rely on. Simplification of intermediary costs stands as the primary motivation. Another reason is the reduction of attack vectors through which the content can end up being modified without permission. Using the protocol designed in the context of the solution gives the user full control over the multimedia files without depending on a third party.

Later, Safi et al. proposed an improved solution for Provenator in [11]. It utilizes an efficient variant of Perceptual hashing [12], an algorithm that takes an image as input and outputs a compact representation in the form of a binary string. Embedding the technique of summarizing the image content into the system's processing flow before storing the related record in the blockchain network illustrates a feasible solution to the main vulnerability found in the original solution. This describes an instance where an 'attacker' submits an (almost) identical photograph, or a reworked version, for publication. Thus, before the actual publication in the network, the algorithm is applied to determine the perceptual fingerprint of the new specimen. This will be compared with the fingerprints of the images already registered in the system. Thus, the publication will not be allowed if the degree of resemblance is higher than a predetermined threshold.

Another proposal [13] for publishing images and provenance data is presented. Here, content creators have full control over provenance and accessibility. Secondly, defining certain permissions to modify published information is supported. In addition, a specialized component for off-chain image storage based on IPFS
(Interplanetary File System) technology is presented. A limitation of the proposed system is illustrated by the possibility of reduced integration with other content management systems since the implemented components are not adapted according to the specifications and interoperability standards. This way, they present incompatibility with the services already existing on the market and with the PKI environment.

In [14], a specialized solution is created to counter deepfake videos. It starts with the decentralized transparency properties of transactions, the immutability of blockchain technology records, and the idea that the authenticity of content is asserted if its history and provenance can be credibly traced to a trusted source. However, we can highlight a disadvantage related to the complexity of managing the storage of video metadata. Every piece of video content needs a separate file for its metadata storage. A more elegant option would be to embed the provenance attributes directly into the target file, along with an additional piece of evidence to prove its authenticity, for example, an electronic signature. In this way, the integrity and authenticity of the content would not require a network transaction every time. Also, an untreated case illustrates the one where the original instance of newly created content is stolen by a malicious entity and then published on the Internet, even before the copyright holder takes this action.

Different from the majority of approaches previously evoked, proposal [15], a blockchain-based system, combines AI, crowd wisdom, web crawlers, and web scrapers to obtain and reactively fact-check information published across the Internet. The innovative point emerges from the fact that there is no imposed dependency between news publishers and the platform. Thus, the system automatically collects released news on its blockchain which is further checked using human reasoning and AI-based techniques for authenticity and trustworthiness.

Several other solutions for data protection that combine the immutability and transparency of distributed ledger technology, leveraging both off-chain and on-chain storage types, targeting different infrastructure devices use cases were proposed in the recent years [16– **18]. Therefore, we see the need to develop a system**
that does not create a dependency between the authenticity of the content and the existence of a single platform designed to provide protection.

Our approach is designed in the form of a content attestation service. The targeted content types are the following: text, image and video. The attestation service offers the ability to ensure content's long-term security and is enhanced by identifying similar assets with a certain degree of similarity while offering distributed evidences of origin. In this section, we delve into our proposal's details, explaining the role of each relevant component.

### A. Proposed **Architecture**

The system architecture, illustrated in Fig. 1, is made up of several components, and presents a modular structure, open to integrations with the creation and preservation services for electronic signatures, as well as those in the field of content analysis. The main actors using our framework are content producers and content consumers. Both sides use applications that are integrated using a standard interface.

The constituent modules are as follows:
CCM **- Client Communication Module: A communication interface for third parties, exposing the** functionalities to protect and verify the authenticity of the digital content in the form of a REST API service. It ensures the secure transmission of data, enabling integration with a wide variety of applications and software tools (mobile, desktop, and web). Furthermore, the information can be verified by directly interogating the blockchain with the resource identifier found in the C2PA integrated metadata. In this manner, every C2PA compliant tool can be used to read and extract provenance information about a registered asset.

PABM **- Provenance and Authenticity Blockchain Module: Implements the C2PA technical standard for** creating and integrating metadata to ensure the provenance and authenticity of digital content. The creation of electronic signatures will be performed by employing a submodule for connecting with a signing service. The module also realizes the decentralized and immutable storage in a blockchain network of the media item, or a series of fingerprints, in case the user opts to keep the data confidential.

LTPM - Long-term Preservation Module: Integration module with the service of preservation and longterm guarantee of electronic signatures. The component supports connection with any preservation service that implements the standard ETSI TS 119512 [19] for long-term preservation of qualified electronic signatures, under eIDAS Regulation [20].

MIVT **- Module for Image/Video/Text: A set of microservices that provide processing capabilities to**
determine the main features fingerprint for three categories of digital content: text, image, and video. To achieve this goal, open-source technologies and architectures, tested and known globally for the highquality results obtained, will be used. Thus, regarding the text content, the ML (Machine Learning) model known as BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) will be used. This model was developed by Google [21], creating global notoriety due to the high performance achieved in benchmarking tests for GLUE natural language processing models. Perceptual hashing methods will be used in the content area of the images and video category. More specifically, the feature extraction and identification scheme will use processing techniques based on discrete sine and cosine transforms [22].

MDS **- Module for Degree of Similarity: Establishes the relative degree of trust between media content**

![3_image_0.png](3_image_0.png)

and is defined as a service that has the task of determining the similarity between media documents of the same type (image, video, text) by calculating a similarity coefficient based on properties extracted using the MIVT component.

# Section Iv. Discussion

For a better understanding of our proposed solution, we detail in the current section how our solution fits into the present context, main challenges encountered for such a solution. We also present the most important applications where such a solution might be integrated.

#### A. Solution **Comparison**

As CPA proposals use different approaches, we present our solution as a comparison against existing approaches. Table 1 presents a comparative analysis that puts our system into the current context. While all of the proposals have a blockchain-based design, just two of them offer mechanisms for combating bogus information. Another consideration is the types of content handled, as the majority targets only one category. Thus, the information context applicability of the platform rises along with its content versatility. Last but not least, following the C 2 PA standard denotes an advantageous feature in terms of continuous technological content adaptability that boosts the potential for solution adoption.

Table I Representative Solution Comparison

### B. Suitable **Integrations**

The proposed solution is designed as a service so that it could be integrated into various platforms and digital ecosystems. This section discusses some of the most impactful areas where such a service could be integrated.

#### 1) News And Media Outlets:

News organizations are trusted sources of information. However, as the pace of news dissemination increased, maintaining accuracy and trustworthiness became a bigger challenge. By integrating with our proposed solution, media outlets can make sure and prove to the clients that the content is authentic and immutable.

#### 2) Trust Service Providers:

The most popular type of digital signatures adopted nowadays are remote signatures, where the private keys are stored it the Trust Service Provider's infrastructure. Taking this into consideration, TSPs could also provide such an integration. To this extent, whenever a client signs a digital document, TSP can additionally provide the functionality of ensuring CPA. In this manner, the adoption of CPA can grow significantly, since the client would not have to implement anything in addition to it's usual digital signature flow. Also, this strategy can spread across multiple economic sector, since TSPs offer services to a wide range of companies and applications.

Digitization of governmental services greatly improves accessibility and efficiency for citizens. However, digitization also introduces a set of challenges related to data integrity and authenticity. Using our blockchainbased solution, authorities can significantly increase the trustworthiness and security of digital government documents and records. This mechanism can be used by the citizens to easily verify the provenance and integrity of the documents they access or even submit online.

#### C. Main **Challenges**

The primary challenge resides in extending the specification to include assertions to identify content similarity fingerprints as the process would require a very thorough analysis. Furthermore, the adaptation and extension of the specification for more content formats, compared to those currently supported, would increase interest in the adoption of such a solution by a much wider range of customers Secondly, the design of content processing modules, respectively the adaptation of A.I. models, and the accumulation of information necessary for training and subsequently for detecting the degree of authenticity of a data source is another challenge recognized at this moment.

A final challenge identified in the implementation of the project is this very novelty which can translate into a reluctance of the human factor in adopting a new technology, especially in the period close to its launch. Users familiar with the use of electronic signatures will be able to adapt easily, but new users who want to access this new service may encounter some problems. For this purpose, apart from the development of best practices and user guides, various workshops stand as a potential solution to present the mode of operation, the benefits, and the security guarantees that the new solution brings.

### D. **Results**

To sum up the current section, we emphasize the main contribution presented in this paper: a framework for content provenance and authenticity. The proposed framework is blockchain-based uses a modular architecture, and integrates electronic signatures standard modules. The main use-cases intended for the proposed framework are fake news mitigation and proving author rights and securing governmental services.

# Section V. Conclusions

In this paper we proposed a CPA solution, compliant with the most relevant international standards. Our solution is blockchain based, ensuring this way immutability and distributed trust. Additionally, the system is designed as a service, offering ease of integration for potential clients. Furthermore, the proposed framework is versatile, taking into consideration various content formats: text, image and video. By using standard interfaces for third-party services, we obtained a modular framework.

Alongside the proposed architecture, we also presented a comparison between our proposal and relevant similar solutions for CPA. Moreover, we analyzed main challenges and the most suitable integrations projected for this proposal.

In conclusion, the adoption of blockchain technology combined with forged information prevention techniques for content verification emerges not just as a technological innovation but as a societal need. As the impact of fake news and disinformation on people's lives grows, developing CPA solutions is a crucial step in safeguarding the veracity of information. Using innovative and secure frameworks specially designed for the CPA use-case, we will be able to foster a more trustworthy and secure digital environment.
